Here are my slides from my Lunch and Learn event today, hosted by the Macquarie Group Pride network. They represent my opinions and not (necessarily) those of the Turing or Macquarie Group (although I hope there&amp;rsquo;s at least some overlap here!)
I was asked to speak about the Life and legacy of Alan Turing and my talk has been heavily inspired by a fantastic panel discussion that I took part in last summer.</description></item><item><title>Imitation Game at The Crick</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-01-17-imitation-game-at-the-crick/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-01-17-imitation-game-at-the-crick/</guid><description>Our next door neighbours here in Kings Cross - The Francis Crick Institute - have a wonderful series of events that are open to the public. Last Wednesday 10th January I was delighted to take part in a panel discussion after they showed The Imitation Game as part of the Science on Screen film festival.
The Imitation Game tells the story of Alan Turing who worked to break the German Enigma machine at Bletchley Park during World War II.</description></item></channel></rss>
