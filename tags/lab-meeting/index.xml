At the following lab meeting, those who attended shared their experiences with the rest of the lab. This is a blog post covering the event and the lab members' reflections from it.
What is the SSI? The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI for short) is a network of UK universities, Research Software Engineering groups and policy makers dedicated to improving the quality, sustainability and recognition of research software.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 19 December 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-12-19-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-12-19-lab-meeting/</guid><description>This week I asked everyone in the lab to create a picture that visually illustrates (some part of) what they&amp;rsquo;ve done this year and a paragraph update. I&amp;rsquo;m so completely blown away by how wonderful they all are that I&amp;rsquo;m just going to jump right into them for this post.
There are a few celebrations and questions we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about at the end of the post too, so its a bumper edition!</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 17 October 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-10-17-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-10-17-lab-meeting/</guid><description>There are so many fantastic updates this week that were all in the hackmd notes because we spent the meeting hearing from Georgia about the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project.
Check out the video below for a quick overview of why understanding autistic people&amp;rsquo;s sensory processing differences is important, and please join the project mailing list at https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience to stay updated on our project.
Thank you to Kate Sytnik, a PhD student who studies sound guided navigation in gerbils in the Leibold lab at the University of Munich, who visited the lab this week.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 10 October 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-10-10-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-10-10-lab-meeting/</guid><description>The week&amp;rsquo;s lab meeting fell on a Data Science for Mental Health Interest Group meeting and at the same time as a Turing Way development sprint, so the updates were asyncronous.
It was also World Mental Health Day so we collected together some recommendations to take care of yourself and your mental wellbeing.

We are delighted to share this video from May of the Pint of Science panel discussion featuring Kirstie Whitaker, Dianna Smith, Rebecca Sterry, Suzanne Iwai and Georgia Aitkenhead on Empowering autistic people through citizen science.
Now on to the updates!
Celebrations and cool things to share Kirstie is excited to be standing for membership of the inaugural Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Steering Group.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 26 September 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-26-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-26-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We had a jam packed update this week (as usual! Do I write that every time? ü§îüòÜ)
Scroll down past all the amazing updates to hear more about Ang and Yini&amp;rsquo;s work on a registered report to investigate the effects of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on brain structure.
Celebrations and cool things to share Kirstie is delighted to welcome Malvika Sharan to the lab as the community manager for The Turing Way.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 19 September 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-19-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-19-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lab meeting today because the timing of the meeting coincided with the Turing&amp;rsquo;s Data Science for Mental Health Interest Group.
The two talks were excellent. Neil Oxtoby presented an introduction to data-driven disease progression modelling, and Alexandra Young extended Neil&amp;rsquo;s presentation with a specific example of data-driven modelling and progression of subtypes of dementia.
This weekend - Saturday 21 September - is World Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Day and while we waited we watched Samuel L Jackson explain how you - and an orange üçä - can eliminate the stigma and dispel the myth that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that can be done about dementia.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 12 September 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-12-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-12-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t have lab meeting as Kirstie, Yini and Alex were at the Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium on Artificial and Biological Cognition, Sarah and Louise were at the research engineering team away day, Elizabeth was at Cognitive Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, and Malvika and Yo were on (what sounds like) fantastically relaxing holidays.
The group still had lots to share though!
Celebrations and cool things to share Sarah spent 4 days in Oslo with the Binder/JupyterHub team and had a wonderful time!</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 5 September 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-05-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-05-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We were in a tiny meeting room at the Alan Turing Institute today because the Institute was hosting a Data Study Group. Many apologies to Konrad Adler-Wagstyl and Hannah Spitzer who had lots of questions from the many lab members who connected through Zoom rather than over fill the room with CO2! Thank you so much for coming and presenting your work on the amazing MELD project (see below for more details.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 29 August 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-29-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-29-lab-meeting/</guid><description>A few of the lab members were at the Cambridge Networks Day today, and so we cancelled lab meeting in real life.
There were still lots of great discussions and updates in the hackmd though. Keep reading to hear more!
Celebrations and cool things to share Kirstie is super proud of Google Summer of Code students Ruslan and Monica who have published their final reports!

There are lots of updates here, and some really fascinating questions that we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to answer, but please do scroll to the end to see a few of Ruslan Yermakov&amp;rsquo;s excellent brain visualisations for the sconaüç™ (Structural Covariance Network Analyses) project (https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona).</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 15 August 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-15-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-15-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We had so many fascinating conversations this week that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to spend as much time as we&amp;rsquo;d planned discussing how to make lab meetings effective and useful for all.
It seemed like interrupting team members sharing their expertise to talk about how to build a space where team members shared their expertise didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense at all üòâ
