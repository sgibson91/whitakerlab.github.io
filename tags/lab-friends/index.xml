We did have phone signal (but no wifi), and I was reading twitter, but I was also trying to decompress and spend time with my partner so I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a huge amount of communicating online.
That meant I missed the opportunity on New Years Day to celebrate some of my friends being acknowledged as APS Rising Stars ðŸŒŸâœ¨ðŸ’« and Prof Ian Goodyer made an OBE (Order of the British Empire) in the New Years Honours.</description></item></channel></rss>
