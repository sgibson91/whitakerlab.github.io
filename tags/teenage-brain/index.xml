My talk is part of a symposium on Network Architectures of the Healthy Brain as Constraints for the Spatiotemporal Patterning of Disease. We were brought together by chairs Armin Raznahan and Mallar Chakravarty and it should be a really fascinating afternoon session.
My slides are linked below, and you can read the paper I&amp;rsquo;m presenting at PNAS.</description></item></channel></rss>
