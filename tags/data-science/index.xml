Here are my slides from my Lunch and Learn event today, hosted by the Macquarie Group Pride network. They represent my opinions and not (necessarily) those of the Turing or Macquarie Group (although I hope there&amp;rsquo;s at least some overlap here!)
I was asked to speak about the Life and legacy of Alan Turing and my talk has been heavily inspired by a fantastic panel discussion that I took part in last summer.</description></item></channel></rss>
