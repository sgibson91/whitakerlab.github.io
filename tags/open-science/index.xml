So in the spirit of &amp;ldquo;blog post or it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen&amp;rdquo; here are my thoughts on citing works in progress.
If you&amp;rsquo;re working under an open licence, anyone can use anything you&amp;rsquo;ve done I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of working open (check out this video of Mozilla Excecutive Director Mark Surman describing the concept if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it before).</description></item><item><title>Open Science: Sharing is caring but is it privacy theft?</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-02-01-open-science-blog-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-02-01-open-science-blog-post/</guid><description>David Mehler and Kevin Weiner are members of the Communications Committee for the Organization for Human Brain Mapping. They reached out to six members of OHBM and asked them their opinions on open science. You can read our collated opinions at the PLOS blog.
(Spoiler alert, my answer to the post title, is it privacy theft? No. I don&amp;rsquo;t really address the ethical challenges of open science in this article. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to say about them, but maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll save those for another day.</description></item><item><title>rOpenSci Fellowship Application 2017</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/resources/2017-09-01-ropensci-fellowship-application-2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/resources/2017-09-01-ropensci-fellowship-application-2017/</guid><description>On this page you can find the answers submitted as my application to the rOpenSci fellowships program in 2017.

This is in contrast to a full WOW which is a two day extravaganza and a mini WOW which is a one day event. We only had one evening but we tried to fit as much of what we knew about working open and collaborating using git and GitHub as possible.</description></item><item><title>Mozilla Fellows for Science Application 2015</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/resources/2017-04-28-mozilla-science-fellowship-application-2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/resources/2017-04-28-mozilla-science-fellowship-application-2015/</guid><description>On this page you can find the answers from my (unsuccessful) application to become a Mozilla Fellow for Science in 2015.
