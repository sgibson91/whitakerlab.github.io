It&amp;rsquo;s a day where the whole senior school (11-18) and the oldest members of the junior school come together to celebrate everything that the girls in the school have achieved over the last year.
The choirs and orchestra were wonderful. This is during their performance of a medley of music from The Greatest Showman üòç Writing the speech I attended Withington Girls' School from 1992 to 2001.</description></item><item><title>Imitation Game at The Crick</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-01-17-imitation-game-at-the-crick/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-01-17-imitation-game-at-the-crick/</guid><description>Our next door neighbours here in Kings Cross - The Francis Crick Institute - have a wonderful series of events that are open to the public. Last Wednesday 10th January I was delighted to take part in a panel discussion after they showed The Imitation Game as part of the Science on Screen film festival.
The Imitation Game tells the story of Alan Turing who worked to break the German Enigma machine at Bletchley Park during World War II.</description></item></channel></rss>
