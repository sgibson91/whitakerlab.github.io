They reached out to six members of OHBM and asked them their opinions on open science. You can read our collated opinions at the PLOS blog.
(Spoiler alert, my answer to the post title, is it privacy theft? No. I don&amp;rsquo;t really address the ethical challenges of open science in this article. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to say about them, but maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll save those for another day.</description></item><item><title>What's Wrong With Science?</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2017-05-05-whats-wrong-with-science/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2017-05-05-whats-wrong-with-science/</guid><description>I was invited to discuss the &amp;ldquo;reproducibility crisis&amp;rdquo; for BBC Newshour Extra on the World Service.
The other panel members were Brian Nosek, Jeff Leek, DaniÃ«l Lakens and Chris Graf. Give them all a follow on twitter, they&amp;rsquo;re awesome people!
The one hour discussion is available at the BBC Newshour Extra site and you can download the podcast from there to listen offline.
