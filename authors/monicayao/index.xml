From this summer, I wish to achieve a couple of things:
Learn about the awesome and neat science behind multi-echo fMRI How this library could be advanced in the future, should there be a new publication about denoising ME fMRI data Adding lots and lots of tests to the library so that contributors in the future could extend the library without worries Familiarizing myself with open source, and continue adding onto libraries as a regular contributor!</description></item><item><title>Google Summer of Code - Monica's Introduction</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-05-21-monicas-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-05-21-monicas-introduction/</guid><description>About Me My name is Monica and I am currently an undergraduate student at Harvey Mudd College (located in the beautiful Southern California). I am joining the Whitaker Lab as a part of the Google Summer of Code program. My interests for computer science are very recent - a year ago, I had wanted to be a surgeon! I have discovered so many useful computer science applications for the medical field.</description></item></channel></rss>
