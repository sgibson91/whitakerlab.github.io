There are some really interesting puzzles there which are definitely useful for getting up to speed in a new programming language!</description></item><item><title>About Georgia</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-06-23-about-georgia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-06-23-about-georgia/</guid><description>What I do at the Turing I joined the Turing Institute for a 2-year contract, based in Kirstieâ€™s lab, working on participatory science, sensory processing, and autism. My research interests include data ethics and the philosophy of technology. Iâ€™m currently building a citizen science platform and developing a participatory science framework.
Before joining the Turing I was a civil servant, and I studied English literature for my undergrad and M.Phil degrees.</description></item></channel></rss>
