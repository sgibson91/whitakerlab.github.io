I&amp;rsquo;m so completely blown away by how wonderful they all are that I&amp;rsquo;m just going to jump right into them for this post.
There are a few celebrations and questions we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about at the end of the post too, so its a bumper edition!</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 17 October 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-10-17-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-10-17-lab-meeting/</guid><description>There are so many fantastic updates this week that were all in the hackmd notes because we spent the meeting hearing from Georgia about the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project.
Check out the video below for a quick overview of why understanding autistic people&amp;rsquo;s sensory processing differences is important, and please join the project mailing list at https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience to stay updated on our project.

It was also World Mental Health Day so we collected together some recommendations to take care of yourself and your mental wellbeing.

We are delighted to share this video from May of the Pint of Science panel discussion featuring Kirstie Whitaker, Dianna Smith, Rebecca Sterry, Suzanne Iwai and Georgia Aitkenhead on Empowering autistic people through citizen science.

The two talks were excellent. Neil Oxtoby presented an introduction to data-driven disease progression modelling, and Alexandra Young extended Neil&amp;rsquo;s presentation with a specific example of data-driven modelling and progression of subtypes of dementia.
This weekend - Saturday 21 September - is World Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Day and while we waited we watched Samuel L Jackson explain how you - and an orange üçä - can eliminate the stigma and dispel the myth that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that can be done about dementia.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 12 September 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-12-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-09-12-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t have lab meeting as Kirstie, Yini and Alex were at the Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium on Artificial and Biological Cognition, Sarah and Louise were at the research engineering team away day, Elizabeth was at Cognitive Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, and Malvika and Yo were on (what sounds like) fantastically relaxing holidays.
The group still had lots to share though!

Many apologies to Konrad Adler-Wagstyl and Hannah Spitzer who had lots of questions from the many lab members who connected through Zoom rather than over fill the room with CO2!

There were still lots of great discussions and updates in the hackmd though. Keep reading to hear more!

There are lots of updates here, and some really fascinating questions that we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to answer, but please do scroll to the end to see a few of Ruslan Yermakov&amp;rsquo;s excellent brain visualisations for the sconaüç™ (Structural Covariance Network Analyses) project (https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona).</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 15 August 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-15-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-15-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We had so many fascinating conversations this week that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to spend as much time as we&amp;rsquo;d planned discussing how to make lab meetings effective and useful for all.
It seemed like interrupting team members sharing their expertise to talk about how to build a space where team members shared their expertise didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense at all üòâ

We discussed ways to learn physics, Neurohackademy, and how to build trust and confidence in a group. Thanks Kirstie, Isla, and Sarah for your tips, suggestions, and a super interesting conversation!

We asked, but didn&amp;rsquo;t really answer, a few questions! Everyone (not just lab members) is welcome to brainstorm together in in our gitter room.

It&amp;rsquo;s a day where the whole senior school (11-18) and the oldest members of the junior school come together to celebrate everything that the girls in the school have achieved over the last year.

If you&amp;rsquo;re working under an open licence, anyone can use anything you&amp;rsquo;ve done I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of working open (check out this video of Mozilla Excecutive Director Mark Surman describing the concept if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it before).</description></item><item><title>Diversity in data science and the legacy of Alan Turing</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-02-28-turing-life-and-legacy-talk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-02-28-turing-life-and-legacy-talk/</guid><description>Hi everyone! Here are my slides from my Lunch and Learn event today, hosted by the Macquarie Group Pride network. They represent my opinions and not (necessarily) those of the Turing or Macquarie Group (although I hope there&amp;rsquo;s at least some overlap here!)
I was asked to speak about the Life and legacy of Alan Turing and my talk has been heavily inspired by a fantastic panel discussion that I took part in last summer.</description></item><item><title>Open Science: Sharing is caring but is it privacy theft?</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-02-01-open-science-blog-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2018-02-01-open-science-blog-post/</guid><description>David Mehler and Kevin Weiner are members of the Communications Committee for the Organization for Human Brain Mapping.

(Spoiler alert, my answer to the post title, is it privacy theft? No. I don&amp;rsquo;t really address the ethical challenges of open science in this article.

We did have phone signal (but no wifi), and I was reading twitter, but I was also trying to decompress and spend time with my partner so I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a huge amount of communicating online.
