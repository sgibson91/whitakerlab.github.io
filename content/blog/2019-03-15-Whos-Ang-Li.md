## Basic information

> Iâ€™m now a PhD student at the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and just
joined Kirstieâ€™s lab as a one-year visiting student at the Alan Turing Institute, funded by Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC).
**My current research interests include neuroscience, genetics, neuroimaging and
artistic data visualization, and understanding or building biomarkers for mental disorders.**

## Hometown

My hometown is a small city called â€˜Hegangâ€™, located at Northeast of China
and adjoins Russia. In winter, it is an ice wonderland, fully of beautiful snow and rime,
and people like having ice-suckers even when itâ€™s minus thirty degrees outside.
Please donâ€™t think that people from cold regions are cold resistant.  On the contrary,
people in south China can endure more cold as they donâ€™t have heating system inside their houses.
As for us, in winter we sometimes open our windows to cool off as the central heating is so â€¦!
(heating system is usually not intelligent but powerful in my hometown)

## Previous experences

During my university period, I majored in automation at Harbin Institute of Technology, where I skipped most of classes because I was doing so many other fun things ðŸ˜¬!
I and my friend rent a house to set up a recording studio and I was in charge of producing MTV.
In my holiday, I did a part-time job as the figurant in Hendian, the biggest cinema city in China, just attempted to watch how they professionally shoot videos.
But after carrying on several advertising films, I realized that I shouldnâ€™t regard video producing as my vocation, as the business often comes first than art and creativity.

I love music, including rock and roll, folk rhyme and pop music. One of  my favorite rock band is [MISERABLE FAITH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_Ftmi0SQK4) and I used the symbol of this band as the head portrait in my social-media account. It encouraged me that one should raise his head and never compromise to difficulties.
Also, I listened folk songs everyday, it gave me a place to release all my stress and [Bi Cheng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REHTXKVQ2Z8) is one of my favoriate.

# Fish in scientific research

Then my interest fell into mental disorder and brain science after watching some related films and TED lectures.
Iâ€™m very fortunate to meet and know my current Chinese supervisor Prof. [Bing Liu](http://www.brainnetome.org/people/faculty/BingLiu/) .
Sheâ€™s a very kind and talented scientist and gave me a unique opportunity to do scientific research. In China, we did an interesting
and meaningful research that developing a novel imaging biomarker for schizophrenia by using machine learning technologies and
large-sample case-control datasets, which can potentially help future diagnosis, medication and pathological studies.

# Fish in Turing

Here in London, although my journey just began, I found Kirstie very nice and aspiring and it also seems a wonderful place to engage in scientific research. I hope we can together make some fantastic findings in the field of neurodevelopment and Iâ€™m really excited to learn knowledge of open science from her. Moreover, Iâ€™m looking forward to make new friends and improve myself here.

Just do it!
