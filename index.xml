Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to their page on how to find the library, and here is a link to google maps to help you navigate through London.
Arriving before 9:30am The British Library doesn&amp;rsquo;t open until 9:30am so if you&amp;rsquo;re arriving before then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to enter through the staff entrance on Midland Road opposite (one of the exits from) St Pancras station.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 14:32:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/contact/</guid><description>There are lots of ways to get in contact with the Lab and we&amp;rsquo;re very happy to answer questions.

From this summer, I wish to achieve a couple of things:
Learn about the awesome and neat science behind multi-echo fMRI How this library could be advanced in the future, should there be a new publication about denoising ME fMRI data Adding lots and lots of tests to the library so that contributors in the future could extend the library without worries Familiarizing myself with open source, and continue adding onto libraries as a regular contributor!</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting on 15 August 2019</title><link>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-15-lab-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-08-15-lab-meeting/</guid><description>We had so many fascinating conversations this week that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to spend as much time as we&amp;rsquo;d planned discussing how to make lab meetings effective and useful for all.
