She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia. She joined the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge in 2012 and conducted her postdoctoral research in the Brain Mapping Unit under the supervision of Professor Ed Bullmore. She remains a member of the department as a senior research associate.\nDr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance images to understand the changes in the brain\u0026rsquo;s structure and function that underlie the emergence of schizophrenia and depression. Her work has shown that changes in myelin content in the brain\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;grey matter\u0026rdquo; increase through adolescence and that association cortex - the area of the brain that underpins complex cognition such as reasoning - continues to develop into your 20s and beyond.\nKirstie is particularly passionate about ensuring that work is reproducible and can be replicated in independent data sets. She is committed to supporting early career researchers ensure they can share their data and code while also following strict ethical guidelines. As a researcher at the Turing Institute Dr Whitaker focuses on how data science techniques can improve neuroimaging analyses, including the application of machine learning techniques to big data sets such as UK Biobank.\nDr Whitaker is a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 Mozilla Fellow for Science. She will be the chair of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping\u0026rsquo;s Open Science special interest group in 2019 and is currently serving as chair-elect. Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a 2016 Global Thinker by Foreign Policy magazine.\nMore information:\n CV: Whitaker_CV.pdf GitHub: @KirstieJane Twitter: @kirstie_j Email: kw401@cam.ac.uk or kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk (both work equally well)  Research assistants Isla Staden  Isla Staden is a Research Assistant in the Whitaker Lab, refactoring Brain Networks In Python and curating data in the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network.

Kirstie is a member of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network: a collaboration between the University of Cambridge and University College London which seeks to better understand adolescent development in brain and behaviour.\nKirstie uses magnetic resonance imaging to investigate changes in the brain’s structure and function. She also uses graph theoretic methods to model the brain as a network. The different parts of the brain do not work alone, they are connected to each other and send messages back and forth in order to generate complex thoughts and social interactions.\nIn work published in PNAS in 2016, the NSPN consortium showed that the particularly well connected regions - the hubs of the network - continue to develop throughout the teenage years, and this may be a mechanism to explain the emergence of mental health disorders during the teenage years.\n  Reproducible research One of the major focuses of the research within Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s group is to empower researchers to make their work reproducible from beginning to end.\n Panel from Repeat After Me, by Maki Naro.\n  Reproducible research is work that can be independently verified. In practise it means sharing the data and the code that were used to generate scientific results. Without the evidence of what was done, journal articles are simply nice, interesting stories. All readers, not just collaborators or the original authors, must be able to check published research.\nThis comic strip, Repeat After Me, by Maki Naro for The Nib is a really wonderful explanation of the incentive structure in academic research and how it has contributed to the current reproducibility crisis.\nWorking Open If all research is published reproducibly the scientific community as a whole will benefit. We will be more efficient: the current system requires too much time spent reinventing the wheel.\nAll members of Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s research group are we\u0026rsquo;re committed to working open. We believe that by sharing our code, documentation, data (where possible) and works in progress we will be faster at answer the important questions of adolescent brain development and mental health challenges.\nYou can read more about working open through Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Open Leadership Training program.\nContact You can contact Kirstie at kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk or on twitter @kirstie_j.\nThe lab tweets @Whitaker_Lab.

At the following lab meeting, those who attended shared their experiences with the rest of the lab. This is a blog post covering the event and the lab members' reflections from it.\nWhat is the SSI? The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI for short) is a network of UK universities, Research Software Engineering groups and policy makers dedicated to improving the quality, sustainability and recognition of research software. They help the members in their network learn software skills and best practices, and advocate for culture change in their organisations and institutions.\nMany members of the lab (current and past) are also SSI Fellows. Can you spot them?\nWhat is the Collaborations Workshop? The Collaborations Workshop (often shortened to CollabW) is an annual, 3-day event focused around bringing together researchers, software developers, data librarians, managers, funders and anyone else who cares about research software to foster interdisciplinary collaborations and explore important ideas around software and research.\nCollabW features a few keynotes but it is largely run as an unconference event with lightning talks, discussion sessions, mini workshops, and speed blogging events all relating to one or a few central themes. This feels radically different to traditional conference events as you are elevated from audience member to participant, giving you the opportunity to create something during the event and have discussions with a wide variety of other attendees.\nThe final day features a hack day where small teams can work on community-generated projects addressing a need they see in the research software community. Importantly, these do not have to be software projects to be eligible. Documentation and event planning projects, among others, have also featured at previous hack days. But most important of all, there are prizes up for grabs for the top 3 projects! 😉\nCollabW21 The central themes of CollabW21, hosted online from 30th March to 1st April 2021, were FAIR Research Software, Diversity and Inclusion, and Software Sustainability.\nSome of the highlights included an inspiring keynote on Diversity and Inclusion from Dr Chonnettia Jones and an unbelievably brave panel discussion on Disability and Accessibility in Research Software.\nThe Lab\u0026rsquo;s Reflections At the lab meeting after the event, each member that attended was asked to produce a slide reflecting on their experience at CollabW21. They were asked to answer the following questions:\n What is something you really enjoyed, was unexpected, or completely different to past conference experiences? (signified by the 🚀 emoji below) Can you share a topic that resonated with you, got you thinking, that you’d like to share/discuss with the lab? (signified by the 🤔 emoji below) You can see their slides below.  _Source link: https://www.krysburnette.com/blog/2019/1/22/belonging-a-conversation-about-equity-diversity-amp-inclusion_\nAs you can see, themes around disability, diversity, inclusion and accessibility resonated particularly strongly within the group. We also found the unconference style very refreshing, if not a little exhausting!\nAdditionally on the third day of CollabW21, Sarah and Patricia\u0026rsquo;s hackday projects on Research Dugnads and Coding Confessions won 3rd and 2nd place, respectively! Well done Sarah and Patricia!\n","href":"/blog/2021-04-08-whitakerlab-at-collabw21/","title":"The WhitakerLab at CollabW21"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/kirstiewhitaker/","title":"kirstiewhitaker"},{"content":"This week I asked everyone in the lab to create a picture that visually illustrates (some part of) what they\u0026rsquo;ve done this year and a paragraph update. I\u0026rsquo;m so completely blown away by how wonderful they all are that I\u0026rsquo;m just going to jump right into them for this post.\nThere are a few celebrations and questions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about at the end of the post too, so its a bumper edition!\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t make it to the end, I\u0026rsquo;ll use this space to say thank you so much to the lab for their exceptional work this year, and to wish you all the very best in 2020.\nPatricia Herterich I\u0026rsquo;m proud to have been invited to be part of the Turing Way core team developing a handbook completely in the open and building a community around it. Working on the project has given me the confidence to present at events again and renewed trust in my skills (technical knowledge as well as organizing and running events), highlighted areas of expertise and shown me what I really value in interactions and collaborations. I successfully applied for a Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship, became a Carpentries instructor and found a new job that aligns more with my values and beliefs. They both provide me with opportunities to give back to the open community that has supported me in the past and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to start mentoring for the Open Life Science programme and get involved in other open projects in 2020.\nSarah Gibson I am proud of how my presenting skills have developed over the last year. While I never considered teaching and public speaking to be my strongest skills, I can take pride in having received very positive feedback. I\u0026rsquo;m also proud of the network of amazing people I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to surround myself with. I\u0026rsquo;m also really proud to have been invited to join the mybinder.org operating team.\n Applied to be a 2020 SSI Fellow 🤞🤞🤞 and openly developed the application on GitHub. Took initiative to contribute/organise for the community. People actually ask my opinion on things now, like I know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. And they think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea for me to express those opinions on a panel at RSE Con.  Konrad Adler-Wagstyl After 10 years being a student, 2019 was the year I finally finished medicine and started full time in research. I\u0026rsquo;ve absolutely loved reinvigorating existing collaborations and starting new ones.\nThe MELD project continues to expand, with new sites, researchers and clinical validation projects. It\u0026rsquo;s been great to see the spreading enthusiasm for working openly in the field.\nOne highlight this year was leading my first open science workshop. It was a real joy sharing the diverse, openly available tools that are part of our workflow and seeing how everyone in the room wanted to try them out immediately.\nOne thing I\u0026rsquo;ve realised this year is that I work best with others. Working so openly in MELD has made it much easier to collaborate. For 2020 I hope to do the same with my work on cortical microstructure - making the tools and data for analysing cortical layers and columns more open and accessible.\nLouise Bowler A common theme for me throughout 2019 has been finishing things - it\u0026rsquo;s the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve wrapped up projects at the Turing, and I also tied up some loose ends from my PhD and finally graduated.\nThe Toyota Mobility Foundation visualisation project has been my most technical project at the Turing so far. I really enjoyed the move into web development and visualisation, and I learnt so much over the course of the project. Looking back at the code now, I can see how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come - it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to say that I\u0026rsquo;ve made the \u0026ldquo;final, final\u0026rdquo; change!\nThe Turing Way has been a huge influence on me this year - as an introvert, working openly in a big team was initially a daunting step for me, but I have really come to value how the effort we put into building the community is reflected in peoples' acceptance, friendliness, politeness and helpfulness throughout the entire project. I\u0026rsquo;m sure The Turing Way is in for another successful year, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to seeing it happen.\nThanks to the Turing\u0026rsquo;s Research Engineering Group for the photo from RSECon.\nAng Li 2019 is a special year for me as a visiting student in the UK and I appreciate Kirstie a lot to give me this opportunity. Living in London means that I have to rent a room and cook for myself. I can do really good cooking now and have fun with my landlord\u0026rsquo;s dog (shown in the picture)!\nI have worked with Kirstie and Yini to develop a registered report based on the ABCD project, with all code and pipeline available. Several of my other works also went well. At the same time, I learned a lot from Kirstie in the use of Github as well as The Turing Way. I\u0026rsquo;m excited in preparation for contributing a new section in power analysis. Really looking forward to more chapters in The Turing Way.\nI have attended several really wonderful conferences in Europe, including Cambridge Network Day, OHBM and Luminous workshop, and they are all amazing! Moreover, I gave my first English presentation in public at the Turing mental health group.\nGeorgia Aitkenhead 2019 has been a year of many new horizons! I\u0026rsquo;ve loved my first year at the Turing -so many amazing people and projects, and of course Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s amazing mentoring 💖. Python turned out not be as scary as it looked, but just as loopy! And GitHub is friendly after all.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve especially enjoyed working with all my autistic collaborators. The insight group has been really enlightening, and I\u0026rsquo;ve loved learning about open science, reproducibility, and neuroscience from lab members. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the chance to deliver my project at conferences and events, and learned a huge amount - MozzFest, the ODI conference, and the eLife sprint all stand out - thanks so much for test-running my game, Yini, Ang and Patricia.\nElizabeth DuPre I\u0026rsquo;m spending the end of 2019 feeling really lucky for being where I am; to be working with so many wonderful, passionate people; and to have the freedom to explore topics I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about.\nFor me, it was the year of joining the Neuro-AI community here in Montreal, speaking at an international conference for the first time in the OHBM open science symposium, and heading back to Neurohackademy for the first time since 2016 \u0026ndash; but this time as an instructor! It was also a year of building stronger communities for open source projects I really care about, like tedana and nilearn.\nYini He This was the first time I stay in a foreign country for such a long time. I am so grateful that you always gave me hands. I never felt alone at Turing, and everyone in our lab is invisible energy for me. Many thanks. With your help, I can face my disadvantage, leave my comfort zone and start moving forward.\nIt is my pleasure to take part in the ABCD project, and from this project, I learned the ideas of open science from Kirstie. It is happy for me to study python with Georgia. Ang taught me a lot about genetic research and became my programming teacher.\nI hope I can take part in and make contributions to The Turing Way in the new year!!!\nKirstie Whitaker It\u0026rsquo;s worth acknowledging here that I suggested 150 words to everyone else\u0026hellip;.and completely disregarded that for my update. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it managerial prerogative 😉\nAs I reflect on 2019 it\u0026rsquo;s heart warming to realise how many of my favourite moments were actually great successes of others. It has been a joy this year to mentor and support so many incredible people.\nTo go around my picture, spiralling inwards from the top left:\n I\u0026rsquo;ve loved living in Greenwich this year, the view from my apartment is beautiful and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad to be able to walk Luna through the park to our favourite coffee shop over the weekends. Georgia has been doing incredible work on the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to build the community in 2020. I\u0026rsquo;m still really enjoying working at the Alan Turing Institute and proud to have helped to shape the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme in 2019. csv,conf,v4 was an incredible experience, particularly because I got to hang out with incredible friends (such as Danielle pictured here with Rojo the llama). All conferences should start with a spa afternoon! The Binder workshops this year were spectacular. Huge thank yous to the wonderful Turing Way team who made them happen! I\u0026rsquo;m proud to have spent a lot of time this summer thinking about how to connect lab members together in a strong, resilient, decentralised network. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure we\u0026rsquo;re totally there yet, but I think we\u0026rsquo;re making good progress. I think this Baby Groot card from Elizabeth is the greatest thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen and it reminds me to focus on the things I have control of and to let go of my jealousy as best I can #GrootGif style 🙌 This year I started going over to write with Kelly Clancy and I wrote up 10 simple rules to run an open and inclusive community online. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the paper done 🤦‍♀ but I did give a talk on the topic and I love this little infographic! I couldn\u0026rsquo;t reflect on the year and not include the spectacular Turing Way Book Dashes 📚 💨💨 These were a bit of a random idea I had that worked out better than I could ever have imagined. THANK YOU so much to the team for running them, and the amazing community for coming and contributing so much to the book. I\u0026rsquo;ve put in the figure from Daphne and my paper in eLife on Data science for the scientific life cycle because I love this paper so much. (Not included, but a paper I also love is the one that James Hetherington led on Design choices for productive, secure, data-intensive research at scale in the cloud.) And to finish, that little picture of the dude looking all cool in his shades and visor, is of James, my wonderful boyfriend just before he ran his first 50 mile ultra marathon. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the work I do without him. I am a kite and he lets me fly ❤️  There are so many things I couldn\u0026rsquo;t fit into this picture. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions in the lab are so deeply valued. I\u0026rsquo;m so privileged to work with everyone mentioned in this blog post.\nThank you so much to you all. Here\u0026rsquo;s to many more exciting times together in 2020.\nAnd now for our regular lab meeting updates!\nCelebrations and cool things to share We had a lovely lab dinner on Saturday!\nPatricia\u0026rsquo;s SSI blogpost on computational notebooks is out: https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-12-18-managing-computational-notebooks-overview-chopportunities.\nPatricia also shared the You Got This conference (18 January 2020) which provides a space for early career developers to talk about the non-technical skills needed for a happy, healthy work life, and a preprint Introducing a Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT).\nElizabeth shared a podcast interview she led with John Borghi and Ana Van Gulick for the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP) about their move to the libraries from cognitive neuroscience and the importance of open data. Take a listen here: https://conp.ca/conp-elizabeth-dupre-ana-van-gulick-and-john-borghi\nShe also shared an interesting discussion in the Carpentries community about teaching GitHub given their recently publicized ICE contract. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the right move is, here, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s something to be aware of. Patricia and Yo pointed out that Gitlab isn\u0026rsquo;t always available in China so it seems to be really hard to find a solution that is open to everyone 😢\nLouise built on Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s point and shared the summary of the Carpentries' group calls about teaching git/GitHub which make for interesting reading. There are a couple of other calls coming up about the git curriculum this and next week; it\u0026rsquo;ll be interesting to see what they want to change. In addition to the issue about GitHub\u0026rsquo;s contract with ICE, there are also some suggestions for alternative stories and the use of GUIs in addition to teaching git via the command line only.\nSarah is SO ready for the Christmas break 😴 (and she isn\u0026rsquo;t alone!). Georgia agreed. She\u0026rsquo;s back in her Scottish hometown to see my family, and getting used (again) to random people saying good morning to me!\nAng shared the news that Nature Materials are requiring data availability statements in their following papers.\n \u0026ldquo;93% of the papers published in the first ten months of 2019 in Nature Materials declare that at least some of the data are available only from authors upon request. Needless to say, e-mailing authors for data is neither a sustainable nor a reliable way of getting it\u0026rdquo;.\n Georgia shared this twitter thread by Rachel Thomas about the difference between what machine learning algorithms pay attention to and what human children focus on.\nYini went to France last weekend. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that the trains, subways and planes could shut down every day because of the strike which has no end date! She reminded everyone to check their travel plans before they set out over Christmas.\nShe shared this beautiful picture of the Festival of Lights in Lyon.\nFinally, you can change your Amazon Smile charity to Autistica to support their great work if you\u0026rsquo;d like to.\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about At the dinner Konrad asked how labs can be configured to engender a great working environment? For example, some have slow coffee making facillities that encourage informal work chats. Making sure that the workspace is welcoming (not in a basement for example!) so folks want to come in!\nElizabeth shared an idea that hot-desking, or a similar semi-fluid seating arrangement could encourage folks to interact with the lab more broadly. I think this can be done really well (but I also worry it could be done really badly!) to help create connections.\nAng agreed that what the Turing does very well is have so many meeting rooms. Probably the best balance is to have places to work quietly and alone (e.g. do some writing or coding) and places for communication (e.g. brainstorming) that everyone in the lab can freely choose between.\nKirstie shared this amazing tool that links Zoom and Slack to provide a virtual workplace!\nPatricia is considering joining the Labour party because she wants to do something to change politics in this country (also, in Scotland they probably don\u0026rsquo;t really stand much chance at the moment). She asked \u0026ldquo;Is that a good idea or is focussing on local kindness better?\u0026rdquo;\nKonrad and Georgia agreed that they\u0026rsquo;re feeling similarly stuck and despondent. It is possible to wait to know who the leadership candidates are before joining up, so it isn\u0026rsquo;t an urgent decision, just one to keep a careful eye on.\nSarah shared that she always finds these questions the hardest section of Whitaker lab meetings? Its hard to know what to ask that isn\u0026rsquo;t too broad that she\u0026rsquo;s not going to do anything with it, or so specific that no one in this group is likely to be able to help her.\nElizabeth, Louise and Yini all shared a strong agree 😅 (Most of the time) it\u0026rsquo;s a good kind of difficult and very dependent on what\u0026rsquo;s going on in a given week. Technical aspects are where the lab are the most different to each other but it is easier to find questions about work processes, outreach, teaching, events etc. In general, it\u0026rsquo;s hard when there is a definitive answer, and easier when there are lots of opinions about a topic and when a discussion about it would be helpful.\nElizabeth is trying to help put some collaborators on a good path for thinking about project management and community building. She asked whether, other than absolutely everything from Mozilla Open Leaders (💖), are there resources we\u0026rsquo;d recommend?\nLouise is starting to think about topics for next year\u0026rsquo;s reproducible research lunches. We had quite a few PhD students coming along last term so she wants to keep things going 😄 Any ideas, suggestions or volunteers? A couple of ideas we didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to fit in last term were testing and research data management. Some project demos would be great, but finding volunteers is much harder!\nGeorgia is doing qualitative analysis and was wondering if anyone has expertise they can share for analysing and extracting themes from group discussions?\nYini shared a paper published in neuroimage: \u0026ldquo;Agito ergo sum: Correlates of spatio-temporal motion characteristics during fMRI\u0026rdquo; (doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116433). It showed fMRI head movement is associated with too many factors such as weight, height, sleep, self-regulation, working memory，etc. She wondered if these correlations are sometimes influenced by mediating factors?\nAng asked about tips for a visiting student to spend his time during Christmas in London (when not working at home)?\nLouise recommended that he enjoy the peace and quiet while he can 😄\n A university friend of mine who stayed in London over Christmas used to enjoy going for walks around the city on Christmas Day/Boxing Day because there were so few people there. Personally, I really like the area of South Kensington during winter - they put lights up around the Natural History museum and it looks lovely at nighttime. They have an ice rink there too if that\u0026rsquo;s your kind of thing. The others museums there are great too - the Science Museum and the V\u0026amp;A. Going a bit further north, Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath are both lovely places to go for walks if it\u0026rsquo;s one of those cold, sunny and crisp days - but make sure to wrap up warm!\n Anything else That is more than enough for this final blog post of the year. As I said above, I\u0026rsquo;m do delighted to be a member of this awe inspiring group.\nHappy holidays everyone. Rest, and enjoy the break 🎄 🎁 🌟\n","href":"/blog/2019-12-19-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 19 December 2019"},{"content":"There are so many fantastic updates this week that were all in the hackmd notes because we spent the meeting hearing from Georgia about the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project.\nCheck out the video below for a quick overview of why understanding autistic people\u0026rsquo;s sensory processing differences is important, and please join the project mailing list at https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience to stay updated on our project.\n Thank you to Kate Sytnik, a PhD student who studies sound guided navigation in gerbils in the Leibold lab at the University of Munich, who visited the lab this week. She interviewed Kirstie right afterwards for her podcast \u0026ldquo;Mind over Matter\u0026rdquo; Stay tuned for some Marxist rants and tips for early career researchers continuing their open research journey!\nCelebrations and cool things to share Louise has a new project starting up this week on methods for generating synthetic datasets. This is came up in one of the Reproducible Research Champions projects last year so it\u0026rsquo;s going to be really useful. (And Kirstie is very keen for it to be a chapter in The Turing Way 🙌). She\u0026rsquo;s also delighted that so many people came to this Monday\u0026rsquo;s Reproducible Research Lunch! Using Docker is definitely a theme we should return to in future; it hits a good spot as it\u0026rsquo;s both useful and doesn\u0026rsquo;t get covered in most programming courses/tutorials.\nSarah\u0026rsquo;s blog is live on the Turing website: \u0026ldquo;Diving into leadership to build push-button code\u0026rdquo;. The following (abbreviated) conclusions are really wonderful:\n Coding with other people is fun! Pair programming is something we try to achieve at the Turing, but it can be difficult to do depending on the project and the time constraints of those working on it. This was the first time I\u0026rsquo;d experienced true collaboration. Where I had an idea that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to implement, and someone with the skills had helped me shape it and realise it. It gave me a sense of community and belonging. I hope I\u0026rsquo;ve forged connections with \u0026lsquo;Team BinderHub\u0026rsquo; that will last the duration of our careers.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a role for everyone in a team and these are equally important. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s reviewing code or writing documentation, these are as important (arguably, more so) than the code itself. Code that does what you think it\u0026rsquo;s doing and has been explained well will have a much longer lifespan than code that is difficult to follow, regardless of how clever it is, if poorly documented.\nI found my strength as a leader. You might remember at the beginning of this blog post I mentioned that I\u0026rsquo;d never led a hack project before, so I also learned a lot about my leadership capabilities. I think I did well. I identified the strengths of each of my team members and gave them a task suited to them whilst letting them explore new concepts, offering my own insight and opinions when required.\nHackathons are not where projects end. While the first 80% of a project to get the infrastructure in place can be achieved in a short amount of time, like a hackathon, the last 20% is hard and often takes longer. But this extra effort is necessary for the software to be taken up by others.\n Patricia was frustrated with the way a recent hackathon was facilitated. She was reflecting on how sensitive she is to being made to feel welcome and how difficult that can be at larger conferences. The main problem is when folks are using the event both for collaborative working and for hanging out with their friends. It ends up being really hard to join conversations and meet new people. (Sorry you had a rubbish time - turns out running an unconference or hackathon is harder than most people think! \u0026ndash;KW)\nYini recommended a Coursera course on \u0026ldquo;Improving Your Statistical Questions\u0026rdquo;\nAng is still working on a revision 😓😓😓 and is looking forward to being more sociable in the near future.\nKirstie really enjoyed the Autistica Artificial Intelligence and Early Intervention Summit. It was two days bringing together AI researchers and data scientists, autism researchers, clinicians, autistic adults and parents of autistic children. The goal was to dream big about how we can use AI to support early intervention in autism, and then brainstorm grant proposals to be submitted next month. Turns out people liked her citizen science idea\u0026hellip;.so stay tuned for a proposal going in soon! 😅\nElizabeth is learning more with Vue.js, and she shared a really wonderful experience that reminded her why licensing is so important! Someone had openly published code to do close to what she wanted https://github.com/harps116/vue-github, but because they licensed it under an MIT license she was able to remix and extend it without any concerns 💃💃\nMalvika is teaching a Software Carpentry workshop this week and shared this beautiful picture of where she works. They have 30 students from different countries in Heidelberg to learn together.\n The view from European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg. Source: Malvika's twitter feed.   Georgia really enjoyed the British Library\u0026rsquo;s Diversity and Inclusion week! She\u0026rsquo;s going to sign up for a staff tour of the basements (and other Turing team members are welcome to join 😱😉).\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Louise is wondering about other resources for learning Docker. The Turing Way chapter is useful but not quite detailed enough. (It gives a good overview and then jumps to \u0026ldquo;type these commands\u0026rdquo;, which is fine for the book but it would be great to link out to some more detailed descriptions.) The Carpentries has a lesson in development, but it\u0026rsquo;s very early-stage right now. Elizabeth recommended Chris Gorgolewski\u0026rsquo;s Docker for scientists workshop! (Side note: that\u0026rsquo;s the course that this picture of Kirstie comes from!)\nYo would like to set up an internship program that isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to Google Summer of Code (GSoC) or Outreachy but that still allows promising people to work for a few months either remotely or in-person and - importantly - to pay them decently for their work. It sucks that so many internships are unpaid or poorly paid and therefore pretty much just give the already-privileged a leg up. The UK is rotten about visas for this kind of thing so the two questions are 1) are there any existing examples like this? and/or 2) Does anyone know how to manage hiring contractors for short periods?\nYini is looking for recommendations of friendly python tutorials for data science and advanced statistics. Elizabeth recommended the SciPy lecture notes: https://scipy-lectures.org, and Kirstie recommended Learning Statistics with R.\nPatricia shared a recent article on impostor syndrome and asked whether impostor syndrome is even a real thing? (Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s pretty convinced that it\u0026rsquo;s mostly used to make individuals feel bad about structural biases they face.)\nElizabeth is looking to re-do her website and is looking for examples of academic websites that folks find impressive or inspiring? Konrad is looking for the same thing and noted that the MELD website is built from the same \u0026ldquo;So Simple\u0026rdquo; theme as the WhitakerLab website. Ang recommends Ted Satterthwaite\u0026rsquo;s lab website: https://www.satterthwaitelab.com.\nSarah wanted to know everyone\u0026rsquo;s favourite way to bug fix 🐛🐛🐛 Yo, Louise and Kirstie all like printing statements to a logfile or console. Konrad recommends pair programming and Yo recommends rubber duck debugging. Louise gave StackOverflow a 💜 because it has saved her (and all of us!) on so many occasions! We\u0026rsquo;re all quite interested in knowing more about the pact with the devil option 😈\n Source: MonkeyUser.com.   Malvika, Yo and Berenice are working on their Mozilla Open Leadership based mentoring program and would love to have feedback on the current status of the web content at https://openlifesci.org. The big question is: if you saw this now, would you want to join? And if not, what could be improved to make it a more attractive option?\nThe lab loved it - particularly the clarity of the timelines and setting expectations on what the participants will be doing. Patricia recommended adding a \u0026ldquo;How to sell this to your supervisor or senior manager\u0026rdquo; page just in case anyone is worried about it being a large time commitment. Louise suggested adding a little more information on what the project idea needs to be in order to apply.\nPatricia is looking for good facilitator training. Has anyone found one that isn\u0026rsquo;t too expensive?\nGeorgia is wondering about community building: how to facilitate it, encourage it, and manage it. (Maybe she could apply to https://openlifesci.org!) She\u0026rsquo;s also doing a 5 minute lightening talk on the citizen science project on the 6th November for the Better Science through Better Data 2019 conference and is looking for suggestions on preparing it!\nAutistica/Turing Citizen Science project This week\u0026rsquo;s meeting was led by Georgia. She presented the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project which aims to better understand sensory processing in autism in the real world.\nThe project is funded by Autistica and grew from a community priority setting exercise in 2016. You can read the report on the priorities and the process at https://www.autistica.org.uk/downloads/files/Autism-Top-10-Your-Priorities-for-Autism-Research.pdf.\nThere are two deliverables from the grant:\n A citizen science platform that can be adapted to answer other research questions A participatory science framework that can be adapted for other projects  Georgia talked us through the goals of the project and the project values. She gave a quick demonstration of how the data is managed using the Open Humans infrastructure.\nThank you Bastian Greshake Tzvoras - who built the demo in just a few days - for being such a fantastic collaborator!\nWe spent time discussing how to recruit and engage two overlapping communities: autistic people and their families and open source web developers, and the ethics of web scraping for academic research purposes. We also dug into whether participatory design - and co-production - is the right fit for all areas of health research.\nEveryone is welcome to join the project (we\u0026rsquo;d really appreciate it) and you can find out more at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience.\nSlides Thank you Georgia for sharing your slides!

They\u0026rsquo;re discussing how to extend the project to include ethics, scoping and designing a data science project, communicating your results (outreach, visualisation, how to write a paper etc) and guides for effective and inclusive collaboration. 🙀🚀💫🙌\nMalvika and Kirstie will be co-working at MozFest House on Thursday 24 October between 10am and 4pm. It would be lovely to see as many lab members there as possible (at the regular lab meeting time, 3pm) for a general update on the Turing Way project.\nKirstie was also excited to share that the Open as in Book discussion this month is right at the end of the sprint - at the time she\u0026rsquo;ll need it most - and on one of her absolute favourite books: Emergent Strategy by adrienne maree brown. You can read more about it (without buying the book) at https://praxis.fortelabs.co/emergent-strategy-organizing-for-social-justice. She shared the principles from the book:\n  Small is good, small is all (The large is a reflection of the small) Change is constant (Be like water) There is always enough time for the right work. There is a conversation in the room that only these people at this moment can have. Find it. Never a failure, always a lesson Trust the People (If you trust the people, they become trustworthy) Move at the speed of trust Focus on critical connections more than critical mass—build the resilience by building the relationships Less prep, more presence What you pay attention to grows   Konrad met this week with someone whose role at UCL is to facillitate the translation of basic science to clinical practice. He found it eye-opening to think about all the parts of a translational project that are separate to any of the basic science: needing a project manager, business plan, considering intellectual property, additional funding, and managing clinical trials.\nPatricia One of the SSI Fellows currently runs a survey on remote collaboration - it would be great if lab members could complete the form.\nGeorgia has been running and analysing focus groups with autistic people and developers. She\u0026rsquo;s found it really interesting to see how ideas are being sparked. Its tough not to inadvertantly lead the conversation!\nYini shared a book she was reading: \u0026ldquo;Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason\u0026rdquo;(https://www.amazon.co.uk/Madness-Civilization-M-Foucault/dp/067972110X) by French philospher Michel Foucault. The book changed a lot of people\u0026rsquo;s perceptions of madness and also changed the prejudices about some specific groups.\nAng shared a paper recently published in eLife: \u0026ldquo;Science Forum: Ten common statistical mistakes to watch out for when writing or reviewing a manuscript\u0026rdquo; (doi:10.7554/eLife.48175).\nSarah was interviewed for her friend\u0026rsquo;s blog about her decision to leave academia. (\u0026ldquo;Spoiler alert: best decision ever!\u0026quot;) You can read it at https://exploringnewworlds.home.blog/2019/10/10/interview-with-sarah-gibson-research-data-scientist-the-alan-turing-institute.\nIsla was awarded a distinction for her masters dissertation! Congratulations!! 🎉🎉🎉 from all the lab 🏆\nElizabeth has been working on her JavaScript to try and help Jupyter Book\u0026hellip; which has in in-practice meant working on her website builder. She recommended Vue.js if you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it yet 🌺\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Kirstie wants to know your thoughts on what would motivate PhD students, PIs and business team members to contribute to The Turing Way? What would be the drivers for members of these groups? What are the barriers? Isla suggested that a barrier may be feeling un- or under-qualified and not wanting to bloat the material. She could imagine potential contributors being nervous of making unnecessary contributions and taking up reviewers' time or adding redundancy.\nKonrad is wondering about business models that balance an open science approach and deliver a clinical tool. MELD has been built on open code and data from the start and the team feel strongly that this should remain the case\u0026hellip;. but building a usable clinical tool (rather than \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; demonstrating the prototype principle) is a massive undertaking requiring many people and significant funding. Anyone know of any good examples?\nPatricia is in the mood to run another ScienceTogether workshop. This was the event that she randomly attended in 2017 that got her into the SSI/RSE bubble: an unconference about collaborative tools. (The site isn\u0026rsquo;t online anymore, but you can checkout an archived version from https://web.archive.org/, or this blog post by David Perez-Suarez). The motivation is that its frustrating to see how few large projects have effective distributed collaboration practices. She\u0026rsquo;s thinking of running it entirely online (terribly meta 😆) and wonders what folks think about whether it would be useful and who would/should attend?\nGeorgia is trying to cut down her paper draft at the moment and is looking for pruning tips! 🌳️️️✂️🍃 She also asked about tips for attending MozFest for the first time. Patricia recommended making a schedule to try not to miss key sessions\u0026hellip;but being ok with the fact that there will be conversations that you get pulled into that make staying really on top of things unlikely 😆 She and Kirstie both agreed that it\u0026rsquo;s pretty intense so be sure to take a time out whenever you need it. Also - the coffee and hot chocolate is free and delicious! 😋 ️🍫\nYini shared a recent paper, \u0026ldquo;Inception of memories that guide vocal learning in the songbird\u0026rdquo; (💰, no OA version), which describes how researchers have successfully implanted memories into birds, allowing them to learn new tunes without being taught. She\u0026rsquo;s wondering if this kind of technology could be possible for humans in the future? For example, for a person with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patient the process could modify the patient\u0026rsquo;s memory in order to help them forget about the injury. Its an open question as to whether this approach would be ethical or not?\nAng wanted to know the lab\u0026rsquo;s views on a recent \u0026ldquo;matters arising\u0026rdquo; conversation about a paper on \u0026ldquo;Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes\u0026rdquo; (💰, no OA version) which was published in August of this year. The comment (💰, no OA version) titled \u0026ldquo;One neuron versus deep learning in aftershock prediction\u0026rdquo; pointed out that a simple logistic classification regression did just as well as neural network models. The authors' replied (💰, no OA version) that these are philosophical differences on the goals of the modelling. Alternatively, a more cynical position may be that deep learning makes a paper more likely to be published in high impact journals than logistic regression 😒\nSarah is thinking of starting a blog and is looking for tips!\nElizabeth is wondering if anyone has suggestions for the ratio of papers-you-review to papers-you-publish? It can be a lot of work to review papers and she\u0026rsquo;s wondering what rubrics people use beyond \u0026ldquo;I think I could provide useful feedback to the authors.\u0026rdquo; Patricia shared a guideline of two papers for every paper you publish because your paper will need 2 reviewers (on average) and you should repay the favour to keep the system going. But the problem with that is that papers have multiple co-authors that could review too, so the math probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite work out. Kirstie recommends doing 4 per year and saying no to the rest unless you would want to lead a journal club on the paper (that\u0026rsquo;s the amount of work that goes into a review!)\nWorld Mental Health Day Although we didn\u0026rsquo;t have lab meeting in person today, the lab wanted to note World Mental Health Day. We collected together the following suggestions that we have each found valuable to support our mental health wellbeing.\n Sharing examples of inclusive work practices can reduce stress - for example adding your work hours to your email signature. Monitoring your hormone cycle can help with predicting and understanding pain or mood swings. There are good online resources for self help: https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk and https://llttf.com. Meditation has helped some of us in the past. Seek medical advice as soon as possible and take medication when necessary. Anti-depressant, anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic drugs don\u0026rsquo;t work for everyone, but they can make a huge difference when they do. Ask for information at your university or workplace. There are sometimes more resources - such as free councelling or health care support - than you imagine (and they can be hard to find on your own). Remember that structural prejudice exists: it may not be you, it may be your environment making you feel bad.  The theme of this year\u0026rsquo;s World Mental Health Day was suicide prevention. There are some useful helplines and other resources listed on the NHS webpage. If you are concerned that you are at risk of suicide you should seek the advice and support of your GP. If you are in distress and need immediate help please call 999 or go to A\u0026amp;E and ask to speak to the nearest crisis resolution team.\n","href":"/blog/2019-10-10-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 10 October 2019"},{"content":"There was no lab meeting this week because there was a Turing Town Hall (where we get to grill the Institute Director).\nWe are delighted to share this video from May of the Pint of Science panel discussion featuring Kirstie Whitaker, Dianna Smith, Rebecca Sterry, Suzanne Iwai and Georgia Aitkenhead on Empowering autistic people through citizen science.\n Now on to the updates!\nCelebrations and cool things to share Kirstie is excited to be standing for membership of the inaugural Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Steering Group. It\u0026rsquo;s taken a lot of work to develop this iteration of the governance structure.

They were working on making sure that Ross' pyls package: https://github.com/rmarkello/pyls (which unfortunately needs to be renamed because someone already has that name on PyPI 😢).\nYo has her PhD programme\u0026rsquo;s 9-month review next week to double check if she\u0026rsquo;s good enough to continue researching with Manchester. She and the lab are all very confident that the answer will be yes 💖\nSarah has been busy writing her SSI Fellowship application but did manage to squeeze 4 Hacktoberfest PRs in! (In the first 3 days of October 🚀✨)\nElizabeth shared this extract on privacy dependencies from the most recent Data Science Community Newsletter (#177):\n these are the revelations that come not from an individual\u0026rsquo;s admissions, but from the disclosures of others or patterns that pertain to a group of which we are a member\u0026hellip;. so much anomaly detection is rooted in graph theory. The groups to which we belong are incredibly revealing and it\u0026rsquo;s great to see data privacy theory catching up.\n Louise finished her Carpentries instructor training! Congratulations!! 🚀🎉✨\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Kirstie wrote a one page description of data science and AI for the Autistica Artificial Intelligence and Early Intervention Summit. It needs to be accessible for a very broad audience\u0026hellip;.who are spending two days designing AI studies! It was a difficult task - there are so many different definitions (to the extent that there are almost none!) For example Elizabeth considers AI distinct from data science, with machine learning being the link between the two, whereas Kirstie defines AI as strongly overlapping with data science! One possible distinction is that data scientists have to carefully complete their feature engineering and data cleaning in a way that AI scientists don\u0026rsquo;t!\n Venn diagram describing data science and the skills needed to get a job in the field.

Patricia was looking for some encouragement to get in touch with a German language podcast that talks about podcasting. We all agreed it was a great idea. Go for it!\nYo is struggling with getting her work done at work - there are too many interruptions! She uses headphones and they help but not enough and was wondering if anyone had had success with \u0026ldquo;please don\u0026rsquo;t interrupt me between time x and y\u0026rdquo; types of agreements in their office? The lab generally agreed that open plan offices are terrible for getting work done, and recommended booking meeting rooms to get totally focused! (This only works if you have enough rooms that you aren\u0026rsquo;t making it difficult for your colleages to have meetings!) The research engineering team at the Turing are experimenting with having no meetings during particular times to try to make it easier for folks to have concentrated work time without being interrupted.

Amazing work. Thank you everyone! 💖💖💖\n","href":"/blog/2019-10-03-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 3 October 2019"},{"content":"We had a jam packed update this week (as usual! Do I write that every time? 🤔😆)\nScroll down past all the amazing updates to hear more about Ang and Yini\u0026rsquo;s work on a registered report to investigate the effects of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on brain structure.\nCelebrations and cool things to share Kirstie is delighted to welcome Malvika Sharan to the lab as the community manager for The Turing Way. She\u0026rsquo;s currently working one day per week as she finishes up her responsibilities at EMBL in Heidelberg and will be full time at the Turing in London mid-January.\nMalvika is experiencing some imposter syndrome (aren\u0026rsquo;t we all?) and is figuring out how to juggle her current work and wanting to get started with The Turing Way, but is overall really excited to join the lab! She asked the lab members for local tips for new folks at the Turing. They suggested:\n If you want fruit arrive early - it gets delivered around 8:30am and is gone by 9am! The tea cupboard may look like someone\u0026rsquo;s secret stash but its actually available for everyone! Explore away! Meeting rooms get booked up very quickly - don\u0026rsquo;t wait as long as Kirstie does to find one (😬😉 \u0026ndash;KW) Go for an explore around the library before the public are allowed in! It\u0026rsquo;s slightly creepy but really fun. Check-out Chalton Street next to the British Library. It has a market and lots of great food establishments. In particular, Mai Sushi!    Welcome Malvika! We're excited you're here!\nSource: Malvika's twitter feed.    Patricia is preparing for a session on the management of computational notebooks, and specifically about preservation. Huge thank yous to Tim Head for brainstorming through this with her 😃 They might write this up as a short paper or Turing Way contribution, so stay tuned!\nYo recommends this paper \u0026ldquo;Ten simple rules for helping newcomers become contributors to open projects\u0026rdquo; (doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007296) and to join Hacktoberfest if you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet! It\u0026rsquo;s a great way to start making little contributions to open source projects, or to bring others into your project \u0026hellip; and you get a free t-shirt if you open 4 pull requests too ✨\nIsla reminded everyone (following on from the Hacktoberfest discussion) that contributing documentation can be a great way to get involved with a project. It\u0026rsquo;s a good way to familiarise yourself with the software, and the best documentation often comes from someone who has fresh eyes on the tool.\nIn fact, the first Reproducible Research Lunch at the Turing (starting next week) is on Hacktoberfest! Everyone is welcome and Kirstie and Louise are looking for suggestions for future discussions.\nChristina is currently on holiday and recommends travelling to St. Petersburg!\nSarah ran her first \u0026ldquo;Learn Azure\u0026rdquo; session for the Living with Machines group (and is now officially exhausted 😅).\nYo also shared the link to apply for the 2020 Software Sustainability Fellowships! Fellows are also awarded £3,000 to spend over 15 months to improve how research software is done in their domains and/or area of work. She, Malvika and Patricia are fellows already and, although the money is fun, they\u0026rsquo;d recommend the fellowship for the networking and collaborations workshop alone!\nLouise is helping to organise a two-day workshop at the Turing introducing Spark at the end of October.\nElizabeth shared ImageNet Roulette. (It was only available until Friday 27 September, so that link will take you to a write up of the project by authors Kate Crawford and Trevor Paglen). She was pleasantly surprised that the public outcry led ImageNet to scrub about half (!!) of their \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; category.\nAng has been exploring the Pingouin 🐧 Python package to perform standard statistical tests. Checkout the interactive demo on Binder.\nYini recommends NeuroPower which helps researchers make sure they\u0026rsquo;re appropriately powered (eg with a large enough sample size) before they start their experiments.\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Kirstie has joined a large collaborative project to make sure that everything they do is reproducible from the start (the project will officially launch around February 2020) so she\u0026rsquo;s thinking about ways to map members of the collaboration to ensure that everyone knows who is in the network and what information they have access to. Possibly using Network Canvas which was built for social scientists to map social networks.\nPatricia is meditating on time sheets. They\u0026rsquo;re good for getting an overview of what you spend your time on (her job has a \u0026ldquo;you can do what you want - we just want to know where people spend their time so we can report\u0026rdquo; attitude) but isn\u0026rsquo;t sure how much time is worth analysing them (beyond reporting so the organisation fulfills its grant responsibilities).\nThe team agreed that actually managing time in an effective way is a tough problem but worth solving. (So much so that the Turing Research Engineering Group has a whole data science meta project on it!) Yo uses RescueTime to passively record what she does which is good for knowing how much overtime she\u0026rsquo;s working, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t love the feeling of being watched 👀. Louise used Harvest to realise that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t allocating her time appropriately to her different projects. For the same reason Kirstie uses Toggl sporadically. It\u0026rsquo;s been really useful in the past to realise what is being squeezed out with other tasks.\nYo is looking for co-facilitators for one of her (many) sessions at MozFest. She, Malvika and Bérénice proposed \u0026ldquo;Choosing an effective mentorship program\u0026rdquo; but unfortunately Malvika isn\u0026rsquo;t able to attend 😭 Isla volunteered - she\u0026rsquo;s facilitated a MozFest session before - so it\u0026rsquo;s going to be an even more fantastic hour at the festival 💖\nLouise is looking for opinions on any of the programming, machine learning or similar meetups around London.\nThe lab recommended:\n PyData London PyLadies London Gender Minorities in AI RLadies London Open Data Institute events One Health Tech BBC Machine Learning fireside chats  Sarah is planning on applying for the 2020 SSI Fellowship Programme and is thinking of using the money and connections to do something Binder-related, for example run another workshop. Any advice or ideas on shaping the application would be appreciated! You can comment on the issue at the JupyterHub Team Compass GitHub issue.\nYini finds herself more effective at night than during the day and is worried that isn\u0026rsquo;t the right way to work. She was wondering how to change that, but the lab members all agreed that it\u0026rsquo;s better to work to your best strengths! No need to change to fit the standard 9 to 5 day 🌃 🌙 🦉\nAng is looking for tips on finishing his first revision to a journal. Malvika recommended acknowledging the value that the reviewer comments added, admitting if there were clear mistakes and clarifying how you\u0026rsquo;ve addressed them, and making sure that your response is kind to the real humans who reviewed the paper. She also recommended (and Kirstie strongly concurs!) getting lots of people to read the response and give you feedback before you send it in. Patricia shared the following PhD Comic 😆\n Source: PhD Comics from 2005!.   Georgia has been running focus groups for the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project and is looking for tips on facilitation. She\u0026rsquo;s also writing up her experiences with building an Open Science game at the eLife Innovation Sprint and is looking for feedback and suggestions to improve it!\nA registered report to investigate the effects of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on brain structure The main agenda item for this meeting was Ang and Yini presenting their work on developing a registered report to analyse the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset.\nThis study is following 10,000 9 and 10 year olds in the USA for 10 years 😱 The goals is to collect a census representative sample, and at the moment the cohort is a little more educated than the whole USA, but not far off! (Here\u0026rsquo;s a link to the participant demographics.) They release data every year: https://abcdstudy.org/scientists/data-sharing which makes it really exciting to participate in!\nTheir research question is whether there is an effect of polygenic risk for schizophrenia (Martin et al have a nice review, doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.12.015) on cortical thickness and surface area at ages 9 and 10. Rather like this analysis by Neilson et al (doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.04.013) in UK Biobank data\u0026hellip;but in young children to see if there is evidence (in terms of brain structure) for the developmental hypothesis of schizophrenia (Owen et al, doi: 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.084384).\nWe talked about the challenges of setting quality control inclusion and exclusion criteria for magnetic resonance imaging data given how many different processing steps there are and Ang and Yini gave us a tour of the jupyter notebooks they\u0026rsquo;ve written containing the analysis code for the study. These aren\u0026rsquo;t yet public\u0026hellip;but they will be on submission - maybe in the form of a Juypter Book 🚀🌟\nThank you Ang and Yini for the presentation, and to all the group for the fascinating discussion 💖\n","href":"/blog/2019-09-26-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 26 September 2019"},{"content":"We didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lab meeting today because the timing of the meeting coincided with the Turing\u0026rsquo;s Data Science for Mental Health Interest Group.\nThe two talks were excellent. Neil Oxtoby presented an introduction to data-driven disease progression modelling, and Alexandra Young extended Neil\u0026rsquo;s presentation with a specific example of data-driven modelling and progression of subtypes of dementia.\nThis weekend - Saturday 21 September - is World Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Day and while we waited we watched Samuel L Jackson explain how you - and an orange 🍊 - can eliminate the stigma and dispel the myth that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing that can be done about dementia.\n Thank you to the speakers for their important work.\nOn to our updates.\nCelebrations and cool things to share Kirstie was pretty happy that she managed to get a bunch of writing done for a difficult paper while her boyfriend ran his first 50 mile race! 😱 🏃 💨\nShe also hosted two Turing Way Collaboration Cafes this week because it turns out that Thursday 18 September isn\u0026rsquo;t an actual day in 2019!\nPatricia has been acknowledged in a PhD thesis for her librarian work (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3384144) which is really fantastic! Reproducible research for the win!\nLouise has had a really good-busy feeling in abundance this week! She\u0026rsquo;s excited about RSEConUK, reproducible research lunches, a Spark workshop she\u0026rsquo;s organising on 1 November, a project wrap-up, Athena SWAN data coming in, and new projects starting soon 😄\nElizabeth had a great time at the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience conference in Berlin, both because of the science and for the meta-science of thinking about how we do interdisciplinary work! She\u0026rsquo;s thinking about the limits of interdisciplinarity, and the changing nature of the jobs we\u0026rsquo;re training people for in doctoral programmes and beyond. Kirstie has the book Range by David Epstein on her reading list to think more about exactly this topic! Reviews welcome 📚\nSarah did an outrageous amount of work at RSE Con UK this week! She had a presentation on all three days! She was particularly proud of the RSE Worldwide panel she spoke on (and got really postive feedback from!) Her slides on \u0026ldquo;Collaborating Across Borders\u0026rdquo; are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3377379, and you can follow along her Zero to BinderHub tutorial at http://bit.ly/zero-to-binderhub-workshop.\nReally amazing work Sarah! Great job 🚀 🌟\nYo shared her experiences of anxiety before meeting her PhD supervisor. Fortunately, these meetings always go well and she has a fantastically supportive PI in Manchester. The take home message was that brains are weird, and believing in yourself is way easier said than done 💓\nYini attended the Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium on Artificial and Biological Cognition last week. She took a couple of pictures of Kirstie hosting the Early Career Investigator Data Blitz and particularly enjoyed Dr Lola Cañamer’s presentation on Emotion Modeling in Robots! Cañamer and her lab made some affective autonomous and social robots with the goal of understanding emotions in biological systems (humans and other animals) and how to build a better robot.\nPictures from Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium #ABC2019. Taken by Yini He, 12 \u0026 13 September 2019.   Georgia gave Patricia, Ang, Yini and Kirstie a demo of the Open Science Game she and her team created at the eLife Innovation Sprint. We loved it, and you can check out the project on GitHub at https://github.com/GeorgiaHCA/OpenScienceGame.\n  Playing a game to explore the incentives and challenges of open research practices!\nSource: Kirstie's twitter feed    Questions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Kirstie is getting excited for Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s annual festival: www.mozillafestival.org on 21 to 27 October. She didn\u0026rsquo;t put in any session applications this year but would love for folks in the group to share what they\u0026rsquo;re working on as part of the many many sessions on openness, digital inclusion, neurodiversity and web literacy 💖\nYou can also support Yo\u0026rsquo;s sessions on \u0026ldquo;Exhausted impostors and superstar masks\u0026rdquo; (with Jez Cope and Emmy Tsang, and inspired by a twitter thread) and on \u0026ldquo;Choosing an effective mentorship program\u0026rdquo; (with Malvika). Or you could attend the third session Yo designed on how to contribute to open source called \u0026ldquo;Make code not war\u0026rdquo; which will be facilitated by Mateusz Kuzak, Anna Krystalli and Raniere Silva so that Yo doesn\u0026rsquo;t totally melt down over the two days!\nPatricia is feeling a little anxious about her final check out - the live coding \u0026ldquo;exam\u0026rdquo; - that is part of Carpentries instructor training. Louise and Yo assured Patricia that she would be fine. They both over prepared for their assessments and said the experience was much more manageable than they\u0026rsquo;d expected. All the members of the lab who have heard Patricia teach joined in to say how confident they are that she\u0026rsquo;ll do a wonderful job, and remind her that competent experts but not experts are often the best people to learn from because they have the best memory for how hard these concepts were to learn. 💜 Good luck Patricia!\nYini shared a recent paper titled \u0026ldquo;Unsupervised word embeddings capture latent knowledge from materials science literature\u0026rdquo; (💰, no OA version). She\u0026rsquo;s interested in knowing more about how AI can be used to generate new knowledge. Could AI replace researchers? Kirstie noted that making publications open access and licenced for re-use is key to achieving the promise of AI text mining, and that we have to be super careful of not forgetting how biased the literature is already. She also shared a fun recent paper on \u0026ldquo;The chaperone effect in scientific publishing\u0026rdquo; (associated blog post) as another example of text mining to highlight patterns in academic publications, and a paper she and Daphne Ezer wrote earlier this year that captured some of the same points: \u0026ldquo;Data science for the scientific life cycle\u0026rdquo;.\n✨✨✨✨✨\nPhew that\u0026rsquo;s another busy week!

I really enjoyed collaborating and working in the same room as people I\u0026rsquo;ve only previously met online.\n When she got back from Norway, Sarah then did a twitter take over of the Research Engineering team\u0026rsquo;s account to show everyone what a day in the life of a Turing Data Scientist or Research Software Engineer looks like!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re all so so proud of the amazing work Sarah is doing for the Binder and Turing Way communities and helping everyone out at the Turing Institute along the way.\nGeorgia was at the eLife Innovation Sprint last week and found it really inspiring! She also got accepted to give a talk at the Better Science through Better Data 2019 conference in November.\nLouise has been really unwell and would like to remind everyone that sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s better (necessary!) to take more than one day off work. Especially when it would stop you from getting even more ill 🤒 Feel better soon Louise! 🤗\nChristina has finished editing her on children\u0026rsquo;s social care and is now preparing a conference presentation on a totally different topic!! Good luck! 💪\nPatricia is making good progress on her good habit forming in Edinburgh by having fruit easily accessible - supported by lovely colleagues 🙌\nYo is climbing sand dunes in Israel and wandering through ancient (3000 to 4000 years old) underground hand-carved water channels under Jerusalem.\nYini is looking forward to attending the Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium. She knows quite a bit about mental health (on Friday afternoon) but the section on robotics is going to be very new! She\u0026rsquo;s slightly nervous but mostly excited.\nAlex really enjoyed the reinforcement learning talks at #ABC2019.\nKirstie has been zooming around the country. She gave a talk on The Turing Way in Edinburgh for the MQ Data Science Meeting (doi 10.5281/zenodo.3402510) and watched some incredible keynote talks from PyCon and SciPy on the train from and to London. Today she ran the early career data blitz at the Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium. She didn\u0026rsquo;t have to use the buzzer on my phone once! Everyone stayed within their 2 minutes. She was so proud! 😍\nThe Data Blitz resources are publicly available if anyone wants to run something similar.\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Georgia would love to hear some feedback on the open science game that her team at the eLife Innovation Sprint created. We\u0026rsquo;ve booked a room to play it together next week!\nLouise is pondering joining Twitter 🙀 The question is how much time it will soak up! She\u0026rsquo;s wondering if Twitter is a useful way to spend your time or does it become a source of procrastination too easily?\nThe lab had a few different pieces of advice, from a recommendation to turn off notifications if you want to concentrate, and to remember that it is a directed graph - you can join and listen and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to tweet until you want to.\nAs to the time it takes, Patricia said:\n I might procrastinate on Twitter, but it connects me to so many inspiring people and is super helpful to rant if you feel frustrated that I feel that makes up for me sometimes wasting a bit of time there.\n Christina is looking for researchers and/or speakers in the UK on AI and environment, AI and global inequality or economic inequality, Law, ethics, and innovation or startups, LawTech and the future and limits of automating the law, AI tools and creativity, IP and AI, AI and trade, AI and Defense or AI and ethics and healthcare. If you do, please get in touch! And if you are knowledgeable about health tech then please join the OneHealthTech Speaker Corner so folks can find you and learn from you!\nPatricia is wondering about the best ways to feel productive when you\u0026rsquo;re the newest kid on the team and its hard to see how you\u0026rsquo;re contributing when you\u0026rsquo;re mostly reading documentation! (Imposter syndrome is a pain in the butt 😒.) Kirstie recomended taking a rubber duck debugging to creating a fun onboarding schedule for the next person! But mostly, hugs 💖\nYo, Malvika and Berenice Batut want to know what open science/source/access/data/whateverelse thing do you think is absolutely essential for working openly? Kirstie (on brand as usual) suggested that this could be a chapter in The Turing Way and answered that confidence is the most important thing.\n Its so unusual to show your work as you go along, but if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been on the other side you know how incredibly powerful and helpful it is! So \u0026ldquo;grasping the nettle\u0026rdquo; and believing that it will be worth it even if it feels uncomfortable when people tell you to do things that you just haven\u0026rsquo;t got around to doing yet is the most important thing (in my opinion!)\n Yini is wondering about how to come up with a good title for her paper. What suggestions does everyone have to come up with the best one?\nKirstie said that she\u0026rsquo;s always had someone else make up titles for her papers, grants, everything really! And so her main tip is to have a first attempt and then get lots of feedback on how to improve the title! She also found some useful blog posts and articles:\n Writing Strong Titles for Research Manuscripts Organizing Academic Research Papers: Choosing a Title And even though this is about the abstract rather than the title it\u0026rsquo;s always worth sharing: How to construct a Nature summary paragraph  Ang wonders about how to learn more about cause-effect pairs data. He found it a little strange to detect causal-effect in data with only two variables. Alex pointed him at a few different (and overlapping) frameworks for causal analysis such as structural equation models, graphical models, and counterfactual analysis. He recommended the book \u0026ldquo;Causality: Models, Reasoning and Interference\u0026rdquo; by Judea Pearl. (If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to commit to the book you can read a nice overview by the author. He pointed out that bivariate cause-effect models are often used in time-series data (sometimes called \u0026lsquo;Granger causality\u0026rsquo;) and recommended a paper by Granger, Huangb and Yang (doi: 10.1016/S1062-9769(00)00042-9, open access version) for a good discussion involving stock prices and exchange rates.\nKirstie and Georgia are wondering where to send the position paper that outlines the goals of the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project. If anyone has any ideas for a journal that would publish something like a combination of an opinion piece and a review article (saying why the work needs to be done) please let her know.\nAlex is looking for recommendations for content aggregators.\nAnything else Whew! Busy busy. We don\u0026rsquo;t have anything else to share this week.

She\u0026rsquo;s finished her enrichment year at the Turing and is now writing up her thesis from her home in Oxford. Thank you so much for being part of the group, Maxine! We\u0026rsquo;ll miss you 💖\nKirstie had some really fun conversations at the INCF Assembly in Warsaw this week (including finding out that the team who collected the Study Forrest dataset have never analysed it, and never intended to!). She gave a talk on \u0026ldquo;Ten Simple Rules to Run an Open and Inclusive Project Online\u0026rdquo; (slides doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3383062, tweet thread) and made the picture below that she\u0026rsquo;s particularly proud of 😂. She was also really proud to be a member of the Turing Safe Haven project team who published their design paper on arXiv this week (arxiv: 1908.08737). Kirstie ran the first Turing Way online Collaboration Cafe this week and so appreciated Nadia, Jez and Malvika joining her to develop the Turing Way project (video: https://youtu.be/I0z7OEbBzes).

A depressing but very useful read.\nIcons for each of the 10 simple rules to run an open and inclusive project online (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3383062.   Sarah and Kirstie submitted a request for a portion of the Microsoft Azure credits donation to the Turing Institute to be used to build a BinderHub cluster at the Turing that will receive traffic from mybinder.org and be a part of the Binder Federation! 🎉🎉🎉\nShe also shared a website (HT Erik Sundell) that shows the cleanliness of a country\u0026rsquo;s energy generation and how the import/export of cleaner energy can effect the emission outputs of other countries that may use dirtier resources: https://www.electricitymap.org It\u0026rsquo;s an excellent piece of scientific communication: the colour scheme is easily understood, and leads to great discussions about which countries you could pair up to reduce the international level of emissions.\nElizabeth shared a very cool tool to \u0026ldquo;Manage Messes in Computational Notebooks\u0026rdquo;.\nAng promoted a project run by his PhD research institution (Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences) to hire some excellent early career researchers in AI.\nPatricia is settling into her new job and is celebrating the office having separate crisps package recycling bin 😋\nYini shared a paper showing that Wednesday is a lucky day to submit your paper to a journal!! doi: 10.1016/j.physa.2016.10.078, author accepted version.\nMalvika celebrated being accepted to co-lead a Mozilla Open Leadership program in 2020 with Yo and Berenice Batut. They will be receiving training in the next months. She also shared some recent blog posts on community building:\n 5 tips to promote ‘water cooler effects’ at informal discussion sessions How to be a pessimistic organiser for successful events  Questions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Maxine read this article asking \u0026ldquo;Do You Want to Be Known For Your Writing, or For Your Swift Email Responses?\u0026quot; and is wondering about the liberation of not having to aim for inbox zero all the time? Or is that just rude to colleagues and collaborators?\nPatricia is trying to start some really organised habits for her new job and is looking for tips for collecting her notes together regularly.\nYini has been thinking about the work of the of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS, https://bids.neuroimaging.io) community in trying to unify the format of MRI data. Having data in one harmonised format makes it much easier to run analyses, but she\u0026rsquo;s wondering about the effects of a prevalent analysis pipeline that may have different preprocessing choices than other research groups would implement. These decisions will always influcent the results. How can we make sure that certain research questions are not ignored because the tools do not exist to ask them?\nAng has noticed that in many regions the individual measures for cortical thickness produced by Freesurfer correlate with the group patterns, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t always the case. It is probably a spatial bias in the accuracy of the recon-all algorithm. How can we (should we) detect subtle mis-alignments?\nMalvika is still struggling to get some interviews transcribed. Does anyone have any suggestions to do this on and off line? (Some data can be used online, others can only be processed locally). Any motivation tips?\nKonrad and Hannah presenting on the MELD project We zoomed through all the updates above, and commented in our shared HackMD notepad before the meeting, because we wanted to have lots of time to learn more about the Multi-centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection (MELD) project\nThe goal of the project is to use machine learning to identify structural abnomalities on MRI for people with treatment resistant epilepsy. Sophie and Konrad analysed a smaller dataset a few years ago and managed to do very well on that cohort (doi: 10.1016/j.nicl.2016.12.030).\nThey now have 450 participants from 18 different research groups around the world.\nThe MELD project has collected brain imaging data from 450 participants thanks to their collaborators at 18 different research institutes around the world. See details of each of the teams at https://meldproject.github.io/groups.   As data on patients with epilepsy is very sensitive - individual participants could be much more easily identified than people who do not have a neurological disorder - all the data processing happens locally at the sites where data was collected. Only fully anonymised data is transferred to the MELD team. Their collaborators around the world follow the detailed study protocols which are publicly available and licenced for re-used through protocols.io: https://www.protocols.io/researchers/meld-project/protocols.\nCortical lesions are very small and it takes a traned expert to identify them. These labels are shipped with the anonymised data. You can see the location of the lesions across all members of the cohort in the picture below.\nLocation of cortical lesions in the MELD cohort on a symmetrical brain parcellation in standard space.   The lab meeting was rather like a second PhD viva for Konrad, with questions on MRI processing, quality control, data transfer and security, patient consent in a future national health service with interoperable data access, deep learning with mesh convolutions, normative modelling to avoid hand labelling of the data, and the benefits of multi-modal data 🙀🙀🙀.\nThank you so much Konrad and Hannah for coming along and sharing your work with us.\nIf you are interested in getting involved in this collaboration please do not hesitate to contact the MELD team at MELD.study@gmail.com.

Yo shared some notes from a similar discussion that she led at Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Annual Festival (MozFest) from 2017.\nGeorgia will be attending eLife\u0026rsquo;s Innovation Sprint next week and is wondering about tips and tricks for your first hackathon. Our crowd sourced advice included:\n Pick a hack project you\u0026rsquo;re really interested in, even if implementing it sounds challenging. You\u0026rsquo;ll be more motivated to learn challenging things if you\u0026rsquo;re invested in the overall project. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to say things like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not confident with this\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use this language\u0026rdquo;. Probably someone else on the team will, or no one will and you\u0026rsquo;ll learn together! There\u0026rsquo;s always something you can do that is useful to the project. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed with the coding side, offer to write documentation instead? It\u0026rsquo;s often overlooked but it\u0026rsquo;s the first port of call for any new user. HAVE FUN! Hackathons are a great way to meet new people with similar interests to you and share knowledge. Two days is a relatively short time when you factor in lunch, progress reports, \u0026ldquo;it didn\u0026rsquo;t install properly\u0026rdquo;, etc so always make notes for what future work others can do and why/how to do so. If you have a fun idea that can\u0026rsquo;t be done during the hack, set concrete actions for how it will be followed up. Ideas flow FAST in hackathons, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough time to do all of them. Design-hacks are totally a thing. Sketch up your awesome idea (pencil and paper is fine) and think carefully about how it could work. Photograph your sketches, document those ideas. Maybe someone else, or future you, can implement it later.  Louise is wondering about best ways to keep GitHub notifications organised. Maybe octobox or devhub?\nAng is interested in resouces to learn Python. Kirstie shared some resources from Neurohackademy:\n Introduction to Python repo, recording Numerical computing in python repo, recording Python tips and tricks (this one is the most advanced) repo, recording Visualisation with matplotlib repo, recording  And to finish, Yini started an interesting discussion about cultural differences across countries. Specifically, she\u0026rsquo;d been told that she holds her opinions about Chinese policies because she\u0026rsquo;s been brainwashed, which she and Kirstie agreed was a very patronising and rude interpretation of her words. We discussed disagreeing with a nation\u0026rsquo;s politics (for example the UK\u0026rsquo;s current prime minister on Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s part) while also being treated respectfully in conversations.\nTo quote Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s advice: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry you had such an unpleasant experience, Yini. If someone is only talking to you to try to change your mind I\u0026rsquo;d say you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be part of that conversation. If they really want to hear your opinions (even if they disagree) then they should be able to do that politely.\u0026rdquo;\nSome fun pictures Here are some favourite pictures from Cambridge Networks Day, and Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s holiday to the Cotswolds.\nLeft: Slide from Roberta Sinatra's talk on \"Physics, interdisciplinarity and the chaperone effect\" (from this tweet thread).

Traditional neuroimaging analyses have considered each region separately and therefore failed to capture many aspects of brain structure and function. The scona project provides open source, documented, tested and modular code to investigate structural covariance in the brain as a network. These analyses are reproducible, transparent and accessible to new and expert brain imaging researchers and network neuroscientists.\nWithin the GSoC program I was able to achieve the following deliverables:\n Development of the command line tool that allows users to complete an entire neuroimaging analysis from start to finish; Implementation of visualisation module to plot MRI data and the results of structural covariance brain network analyses; Improvement of the visualisation results and output reports at the end of the analysis, as a result the final visualisations are ready for publication in a scientific journal; Well-written documentation and clear tutorials to help users better understand how to use the package and its functionalities; Bugs-fixing and solving issues in the project.

Rich-club nodes and connections between them are displayed.\nIn the top-right figure, global measures of the network are shown compared to the values of the global measures of randomly generated networks. These measures are: a: assortativity, C: clustering coefficient, L: shortest path, E: efficiency, M: modularity, σ: small world coefficient. You can read more on the measures here.\nIn the bottom-right, you can see the figure of anatomical network layout in the sagittal orientation with the custom colors for each \u0026ldquo;module\u0026rdquo; measure.\nRun tutorials right away Moreover, anyone can easily reproduce the code in the scona tutorials anywhere by using binder. Simply follow the links below and you will be able to interact with the selected tutorial (jupyter notebook) in a live environment!\n Global measures visualisation Interactive 3D visualisations  scona is openly available software to allow all neuroscience researchers to conduct reproducible and biologically meaningful investigations of the human brain. Feel free to chat with the community and try the package yourself in Binder.\nChallenges Of course, there were some challenges during my project. To name a few: writing understandable tutorials, adjusting parameters to ensure the produced figures are ready to be published in the research paper and … colorbars (do not underestimate them!). Probably the hardest thing was to write clear tutorials to demonstrate the usage of the scona package for data visualisation. Together with the supportive community, we managed to accomplish the task. Moreover, owing to the constant feedback from my mentor, I was able to develop visualisation functions that produce publication-ready plots, thereby achieving my goal in this project.\nWish I could do more Now, when I became comfortable with the project, I feel like I could have contributed more to the development of the command-line tool itself if I initially had more knowledge in the neuroscience field. Nevertheless, Kirstie managed to explain the gist of the major concepts and ideas to newbies like me, which allowed me to write documentation and to improve the code for conducting brain analysis, i.e. to improve the performance of small-world coefficient calculations.\nWhat I learned Besides improving my technical skills, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned much more about the open-source world of software development. There are a lot of enthusiastic and top-notch contributors who support different open-source initiatives by devoting their time and efforts to build projects that make people\u0026rsquo;s lives better and easier.\nWhat is more, I was able to acquire a great understanding about open science principles and reproducibility in science from my mentor. Dr Kirstie Whitaker addresses the flaws in the academic world by advocating for reproducible \u0026amp; replicable research and promoting a true ideal for open science that supports diversity and inclusion.\nThanks Many thanks to my mentor Dr Kirstie Whitaker and to Isla Staden, who were always very helpful and responsive.\n","href":"/blog/2019-08-23-ruslan-final-report-gsoc19/","title":"Ruslan's GSoC Final Report"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/ruslanyermakov/","title":"ruslanyermakov"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/scona/","title":"scona"},{"content":"There were SO many great questions and conversations at this week\u0026rsquo;s lab meeting that we ran over time and ended up chatting for more than 2 hours.\nThere are lots of updates here, and some really fascinating questions that we didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to answer, but please do scroll to the end to see a few of Ruslan Yermakov\u0026rsquo;s excellent brain visualisations for the scona🍪 (Structural Covariance Network Analyses) project (https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona).\nCelebrations and cool things to share Patricia is starting a new job in September and her new team is running a survey on FAIR data policies and practices. It would be great for everyone to complete it and share widely!\n https://www.fairsfair.eu/fairsfair-open-consultation-fair-data-policies-and-practices  Maxine is back on track with thesis writing after a rough few weeks of re-running all of her analyses because there was a mistake at the very start 😱 This week she\u0026rsquo;s writing new analyses (rather than re-writing the chapters that had to be updated). Kirstie is wildly proud that a whole PhD can be re-run in just a few weeks! Reproducible research FTW ✨ 🙌 🚀 😻\nIn contrast, Josh has been busy incorporating feedback for his thesis proposal. He also took a break from his PhD by writing a blog on Four things I wish I\u0026rsquo;d known before starting a PhD. (With the excellent subtitle: Some Of Which I Probably Could Have Guessed And Most Of Which I Was Probably Told At Some Point, But Now Know For Sure.)\nSarah is much more organised with her post-it to-do list method 💖\nChristina is working on a fascinating project thinking about the ethics of machine learning in children\u0026rsquo;s social care. Good luck with the tight deadline Christina!!\nLouise shared a new colourmap from Google: Turbo: An improved rainbow colormap for visualisation. The linked blog is great discussion of the pros and cons of rainbow colourmaps 🌈\nYini is \u0026ldquo;Learning Python the Hard Way\u0026rdquo; (via the book by Zed A Shaw recommended by Sarah and Georgia. She found this video on youtube really helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k8s8r5DXNU.\nYini also recommended the \u0026ldquo;Tell me a story\u0026rdquo; point of view article by Joshua Sanes at eLife (doi: 10.7554/eLife.50527). Sanes suggests starting with the introduction and results sections of a paper and leaving the figures to later.\n(Side note: This is not Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s style at all, she\u0026rsquo;s super into figures to tell the story, but its worth reading and seeing what fits your workflow best!)\nMalvika is enjoying getting to know The Turing Way better, and would love to hear about your contributions and ideas for the project.\nAng is really happy to get a revise and resubmit re-consideration by the editor for his first first author paper. Fingers crossed 🤞 🤞\nYo is having tonnes of fun interviewing participants for her PhD research study. About 10 hours so far, and at least as much more over the next few weeks. She\u0026rsquo;s feeling happy and excited that people are so ready and willing to help 💖 Good luck on all the transcriptions Yo!\nYo also shared http://citeas.org as a really useful page to know how to cite something (dois, urls and arXiv ids all included).\nElizabeth was sad to miss Fernando Perez\u0026rsquo;s live stream at the American National Science Foundation last week, but recommends going through the 🌟 amazing 🌟 slides:\n https://speakerdeck.com/fperez/open-source-academic-science-and-the-public-mission-of-research-reflections-from-the-field  Georgia is excited that we have some of our first contributions to the citizen science project from our survey and mailing list ✨\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Sarah asked \u0026ldquo;What are the lab\u0026rsquo;s tips for keeping your energy/interest going through a conference?\u0026rdquo;\nWe recommended taking breaks and feeling ok with skipping some sessions. A tired researcher sitting at the back of a hot conference hall isn\u0026rsquo;t learning anything, and if you\u0026rsquo;re fresh then you\u0026rsquo;re able to be present and focus on the talks.\nPatricia asked for the group\u0026rsquo;s recommendations on keeping desktops (in physical and virtual space) decluttered? How do you make time for that in your calendar? Every 6 months?\nYini pointed out that it helps that the Turing only has hot desks so you have to tidy up every evening 😕\nChristina is learning about different types of machine learning - supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised or reinforcement - and the different ways they can be applied. Specifically she\u0026rsquo;s interested in thinking about the ethical considerations that differ across the different types of analyses. She\u0026rsquo;s had lots of useful conversations at the Turing, and we had some great discussion at the end of lab meeting. This is going to be an awesome paper that she\u0026rsquo;s currently writing!\nGeorgia is working out comms strategies for the citizen science project. She\u0026rsquo;d love suggestions how to engage and involve people?\nElizabeth is brainstorming what an ideal Jupyter \u0026ldquo;authoring experience\u0026rdquo; could look like. She\u0026rsquo;d love comments on this initial sketch of a workflow!\nAng wonders if there\u0026rsquo;s a better way to test the heterogeneity of one-dimensional continuous data across two groups? The goal is to test whether one measurement is more heterogeneous than another (instead of, for example, performing an F-test, which comparing the variance of two distributions).\nYo is wondering about tips for applying for research fellowships?\nAnything else We didn\u0026rsquo;t answer many of our own questions, because Google Summer of Code student Ruslan Yermakov joined us to present his work on scona🍪.\nYou can read his final report and check out the fantastic tutorials he made in Binder:\n Global measures visualisation Interactive 3D visualisations  Here are a few lovely images to close out the blog.\n Top left: Network nodes coloured by module.

","href":"/blog/2019-08-22-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 22 August 2019"},{"content":"Questions and Answers about this Summer First, let me bring back an excerpt from my introduction:\n From this summer, I wish to achieve a couple of things:\n Learn about the awesome and neat science behind multi-echo fMRI How this library could be advanced in the future, should there be a new publication about denoising ME fMRI data Adding lots and lots of tests to the library so that contributors in the future could extend the library without worries Familiarizing myself with open source, and continue adding onto libraries as a regular contributor!   This is what I wanted to do this summer! It\u0026rsquo;s time to reflect.\nWhat I wanted to do I wanted to add a unit test to all the different functions in the tedana library, making it future proof for those who contribute to it in the future.\nMy project with tedana was to make the testing deck more robust. The project was trying to make contributing more friendly for everyone! One big reason being that many who utilize tedana in publications are neuroscientists who do not regularly code, but the tedana community members want to welcome them to!\nThis project acheives that goal because it would be a lot more welcoming to have simple unit test functions that not only show them what the functions are doing, but also catch any potential bugs or silly mistakes they could make.\nWhat I did In the end, I added a \u0026ldquo;smoke test\u0026rdquo; to all the functions. Smoke tests simply test that the functions generate an output that is not null when random inputs are passed in. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently started on adding a unit test for all the functions.\nLinks of some of the pull requests and issues!\n Updates to the home page of documentation Clarification for the ME-fMRI section in documentations Loading in current year during runtime for copyrights Smoke tests for files Issue addressing documentation Issue addressing smoke test for first steps of tedana Issue addressing smoke test for helper files of tedana  I don\u0026rsquo;t have a comparison of the before/after of test coverage but a recent screenshot from a recent code coverage graph!\n  Screenshot of code coverage!   This is also a screenshot of the different tests passing!\n  Screenshot of all the tests passing! Note: Warnings are suppressed for a better picture.   What I didn\u0026rsquo;t do Did not acheive all my hope and dreams - adding a unit test to every single function.\nThe reason was simple, lots in my life happened this summer. Many different times, I wanted to flat out quit GSoC and focus on managing the stress that came from life\u0026rsquo;s challenges. Nonetheless, I\u0026rsquo;m extremely grateful to Kirstie and the tedana members for allowing me to stay onboard for the project, and guiding me along the way! Josh and Taylor were also extremely helpful and patient with me, answering the sudden bursts of questions I would get at once!\nWhat was hard Getting used to the workflow and understanding the technology behind tedana.\nOpen source is extremely independent but also extremely dependent on the members of the community. A big problem I had was wanting to work by myself to understand the technology as well as the library itself. tedana is a difficult project to understand! I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read the papers by Kundu many times, and it is still hard to grasp. I was intimidated by the different building blocks of the library, but I had focused too much on the medical side, and forgot that I was supposed to handle more of the technological sides!\nEven when encountering different roadblocks like understanding the library, I wanted to overcome it myself. Many of those would have been solved by the members, I could have asked them for explanations, yet I was stubborn.\nIf I were to do things differently I would:\n Reach out to the members\u0026hellip; early. The sooner the better. Understand that you have a mentor for a reason, and it is okay to ask for help. The community chats are terrifying at times (toooons of messages and none that you understand) so sending a private message to a community member and asking them a question is totally fine too!  To the future GSoC students - don\u0026rsquo;t be scared like I was, and starting late is better than starting never!\nWhat I learned Testing!!! There are so many different ways to test functions. Just in the tedana library, there are break tests, smoke tests, unit tests, integration tests. Quality assurance isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as it seems.\nIn addition, I learned that the use of Github isn\u0026rsquo;t just version control, it is for you to make a pull request from your code, so others can review it. One helpful thing I have recently come to understand is that pull requests are helpful because it uploads your code to a place where all community members can see. They can then help you debug it by running it on their local machines!\nSo what if the PR is rejected?! You will have an improved version of the code from the community member\u0026rsquo;s reviews. That means it\u0026rsquo;s time to open a PR that can be merged!\nWhat I’m going to do next As cheesy as it sounds, this summer made me realize that a lot of what you plan do not come to actualization. So many different circumstances appeared, and I have learned to deal with some stressful real-life experiences. The next step for me is to focus on myself. I don’t think I’m at a good stage for more work, and I want to take a break from school (for a semester or a year). It may be too late for the fall semester, but I think that I will take the spring off to go back to China and spend a lot more time with family and getting to know my culture!\n","href":"/blog/2019-08-22-monica-final-report-gsoc19/","title":"Monica's GSoC Final Report"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/monicayao/","title":"monicayao"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/tedana/","title":"tedana"},{"content":"We had so many fascinating conversations this week that we didn\u0026rsquo;t get to spend as much time as we\u0026rsquo;d planned discussing how to make lab meetings effective and useful for all.\nIt seemed like interrupting team members sharing their expertise to talk about how to build a space where team members shared their expertise didn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense at all 😉\nCheck out all the links below! We hope they\u0026rsquo;re useful to you ✨\nCelebrations and cool things to share Kirstie had a wonderful time at Neurohackademy and shared the YouTube playlist that has all the talks from all four years of the summer school. She was also delighted to celebrate Gamechangers for Diversity in STEM being featured in the Turing annual report! (Check out pages 35 to 38.)\nMaxine is enjoying writing up her thesis and a short break to come and say hello in person 👋\nSarah is leading a \u0026ldquo;Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches\u0026rdquo; skills development group with some collaborators at the Turing. Should be fun, and yummy 😋\nLouise lead a discussion of how useful git blame can be, and how terrible the name is for making people feel welcome and supported! git blame lets you find out in which commit an edit to a particular function was made and she\u0026rsquo;s found it really useful for figuring out the context of a change when the file itself was too big to go through the commit history manually. There are some really interesting conversations about potentially renaming the function, for example in the GitLab UI.\nGeorgia is really excited about the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project building up. She\u0026rsquo;s organising focus groups for September and working with collaborators to get the demo developed into a minimum viable product so we can run user testing interviews 🚀🌟\nAng shared beautiful visualization tool in Python: Altair. Have a play yourself on Binder.\nMalvika is hosting a statistics workshop followed by a Machine Learning in R course later this year and shared a lovely Introduction to Machine Learning resource with tutorials, exercises and videos by Bernd Bishl and his team.\nAlex shared Daft: an amazing package to beautifully render probabilistic graphical models.\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Louise asked the group their opinions on tutorials to learn git. The Software Carpentry lesson is very famous but some instructors don\u0026rsquo;t find it very useful for new learners. Kirstie recommended Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s tutorial from Neurohackademy and the recording of her talk, and the Friendly GitHub Intro workshop that she\u0026rsquo;s run multiple times.\nSarah is looking for anyone with expertise in kube-lego and Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt! (No one was able to help her 😭)\nWe did have some suggestions around ways to manage her TODO lists though.\n An infinite list: https://dynalist.io Trello: https://trello.com Asana: https://asana.com Pomodoro technique: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique  An online timer: http://e.ggtimer.com/pomodoro   Toggl: https://toggl.com Having an accountabilibuddy to keep you focused when you could easily be derailed by other tasks. Doing the thing you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do first so there is a reward at the end (and so you don\u0026rsquo;t spend lots of time on it!)  Maxine and the One Health Tech community are looking for international terms to monitor ethnic diversity at their events. The best solution we found was to use just the top level from the UK groupings but we did also discuss tools that can summarise free text for the specific purpose that is needed. For example the GenderCoder tool lets people enter their gender in free text so they can self identify, and also facilitates grouping free text answers that are all versions of the same gender (eg: M, male, a man, Male are all grouped together.)\nThis led really well onto a discussion that Georgia raised about monitoring diversity for her project. Some suggestions were to have continuous monitoring and looking at diversity in leadership. In general the take home message was that recording nothing makes reflections almost impossible in the future!\nYini asked for the group\u0026rsquo;s opinion on two journals (NeuroImage and Human Brain Mapping) going open access. Kirstie had a strong opinion that these are business model changes from the publishers and the open access fees do not make the journals all that more \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;accessible\u0026rdquo;. In fact, in writing up this blog she found a recent blog about \u0026ldquo;Why open access will boost publisher profits\u0026rdquo; which makes that point really clearly.\nAlex asked for tips and tricks for reviewing the literature when starting out on a new project. We recommended this 10 Simple Rules paper by Marco Pautasso in 2013 (doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003149)\nRethinking lab meeting Although the discussion points above filled a lot of lab meeting *[*😻 \u0026ndash; KW] we still discussed Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s proposed guidelines for lab meeting.\nThey explain the process and motivation for bringing groups of people who all work very closely with Kirstie together. We\u0026rsquo;ll finish this post with a shout out to all the lab meeting blogs so far and the really fantastic conversations that they have inspired, and a paragraph about the core reason why Kirstie is so passionate about having everyone participate every week.\nTrust and the power of decentralised networks (Copied from the lab meeting guidance and used under CC-BY license.)\nThere is a great risk that the projects in the group are siloed and that Kirstie becomes a bottle neck for communication. This is a centralised network (A in the diagram below). In contrast, a decentralised network (B) shares information more effectively. Small world networks in particular are efficient and resilient.\n Decentralization diagram uploaded to Wikimedia Commons by Adam Aladdin. Reused under a CC-BY license.   I would like this lab to be as decentralised as possible. I would like lab members to find the answers to their questions quickly and receive help and support from all other lab members in all dimensions.\nOne of the core goals of all Whitaker Lab is to improve collaboration (in academia and in the world!) And a core requirement of effective collaboration is trust. In fact, there was an article in the Harvard Business Review in 2011 that named trust as the \u0026ldquo;The One Thing That Makes Collaboration Work\u0026rdquo;.\nBuilding trust is a difficult and multi-dimensional, but by being vulnerable with each other is one core component. In her book Emergent Strategy (which I love love love), and in this blog post from 2013, adrienne maree brown describes the following principles:\n  lao tzu says \u0026ldquo;if you don’t trust the people, they become untrustworthy.\u0026rdquo; the first principle is a positive flip of this statement – if you trust the people, they become trustworthy. trust is a seed that grows with attention and space. the facilitator can be a gardener, or the sun, the water. there is a conversation in the room that wants and needs to be had. don\u0026rsquo;t force it, don\u0026rsquo;t deny it. let it come forth. the connection between the individuals is what makes the whole group/community strong.   (Note that brown self determines what she capitalises, which reminds me of - and is possibly inspired by - black feminist writer bell hooks who did not capitalise her name in order \u0026ldquo;to focus on the substance of her work, not who [she] is\u0026rdquo;.)\nIf we want information to flow around a decentralised network, then we need to trust each other. I believe that building connections between individual people are the magic that will lead to the most exciting and innovative data science.\n","href":"/blog/2019-08-15-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 15 August 2019"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/georgiaaitkenhead/","title":"georgiaaitkenhead"},{"content":"This lab meeting included some discussions ranging from READMEs, to academic culture, and studies on bias.\nCelebrations and cool things to share 🙌 Kirstie has posted blog posts from lab meeting on 18 and 25 July! 💖 👇\n https://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-07-18-lab-meeting https://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/2019-07-25-lab-meeting  Louise has recently been going through some problems from Project Euler in the REG\u0026rsquo;s coding club. There are some really interesting puzzles there which are definitely useful for getting up to speed in a new programming language! The group have been using some niche programming languages, such as \u0026ldquo;post-script\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;haskell\u0026rdquo;. Louise is going to learn F#, a functional language. Project Euler is good because there are lots of little challenges which don\u0026rsquo;t take too long to solve and can be broken down into steps.\nSarah is going through a phase of learning new stuff in Python. She has been autogenerating log files, and html requests, and as a side project working on a bot which automates with GitHub\u0026rsquo;s API.\nAng recoommended LeetCode as a great way to learn code. 👍 👍\nLouise and Sarah made the point that coders are pro level googlers - it\u0026rsquo;s not cheating!\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about ❓ Kirstie loved being in a breakout discussion on code review at Neurohackademy. The key point was short code: only 50 lines long (200 absolute max). Kirstie would love to see if lab members can get some eyes on each other\u0026rsquo;s code - maybe just one or two functions each. She also shared some useful code review resources:👇\n Code review in Turing Way: https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/reviewing/reviewing.html Notes from breakout discussion: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/656  Louise has been thinking that it\u0026rsquo;s good if the lab meetings can get into specifics. Her project has individual commits which are manageable chunks. She suggested a code review in that style.\nSarah was wondering what kind of project lab members would like to do together to build trust and learn how we can help each other?\nAng wanted to know if there were any guides for researchers to protect themselves under the current open science system? He pointed out there have been instances where papers have been borrowed from but not cited, or reviewers have held onto submissions and published their own papers in the meantime.\nWe discussed how protecting researchers may not be the right way to solve the problem of plagerism in science, and that a culture shift is needed to make it not okay to steal people\u0026rsquo;s work.\nOne way to do that is researchers only publishing in open journals, and moving away from publish or perish. This is a great TEDx talk by Rachael Ainsworth on Academia\u0026rsquo;s broken culture.\nYini shared a paper about bias: Potential reporting bias in neuroimaging studies of sex differences by David, Naudet et al. (2018). doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-23976-1. She has been thinking about bias a lot when it comes to gender and science: more than 80% of researchers will report that there is a gender difference, but only 2 studies show this. She thought a reason might be that people like to report a positive result, and this contributes to the bias.\nYini summarised findings from this paper for the lab group. Overall, 158 papers (88%) reached \u0026ldquo;positive\u0026rdquo; conclusions in their abstract and presented some foci - locations in the brain - related to sex differences.\nTo quote from the abstract:\n Few articles (n = 2) had titles focused on no differences or on similarities (n = 3) between sexes\u0026hellip; There was no statistically significant relationship between sample size and the number of foci\u0026hellip; The extremely high prevalence of \u0026ldquo;positive\u0026rdquo; results and the lack of the expected relationship between sample size and the number of discovered foci reflect probable reporting bias and excess significance bias in this literature.\n Anything else We also shared some READMEs from our projects, and discussed what different purposes they served.\nLouise shared one on Traffic mobility. It\u0026rsquo;s currently a private repo but it will go public at some point. It contains the docker-compose file that sets up the traffic visualisation project Louise showed in the slides for a previous lab meeting (see the lab meeting blog from 25 July). Louise\u0026rsquo;s README is also the place where her and her team drop any useful documents from meetings and planning sessions. This README is all about the general: what you should do while you\u0026rsquo;re here, and how to get it up and running.\nSarah shared her README: binderhub-deploy button. This ✨automagically✨ deploys a BinderHub to Azure using a button click! This README is basically about how you use the software. There are three ways you can run the repository, so it goes through all three ways of doing it.\nGeorgia shared the README for her citizen science project. This README explains about the project and how to contribute. Beacuse it\u0026rsquo;s not only for a technical audience, it tries to explain routes to contribution clearly, and in an encouraging way.\nAng shared a README from a project he\u0026rsquo;s working on which aims to develop clincal-relevant biomarkers for schizophrenia. It\u0026rsquo;s currently a private repo but it will go public at some point. It links to a jupyter notebook to replicate the results of the study so that others can calculate the published biomarker for different neuroimaging data.\n","href":"/blog/2019-08-08-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 08 August 2019"},{"content":"This week’s lab meet was petite but by no means picayune! We discussed ways to learn physics, Neurohackademy, and how to build trust and confidence in a group. Thanks Kirstie, Isla, and Sarah for your tips, suggestions, and a super interesting conversation!\nCelebrations and cool things to share Kirstie is finding Neurohackademy great so far – with lots of awesome talks! Here are a select few 👇\n Codeclimate for readable code: https://codeclimate.com Intro to git: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide The most fantastic git resource: https://ohshitgit.com A bunch of thing you can do with Jupyer: https://blog.jupyter.org/i-python-you-r-we-julia-baf064ca1fb6 A great project template for a research project: https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science  Georgia (and Kirstie) got ethics approval for the Citizen Science Project – the day has finally arrived! YAY! The GitHub repository and survey are now live, and we’ve sent an email to the project\u0026rsquo;s mailing list to launch it. 🚀\nThere are lots of ways to be involved:\n The repo for the project is now live and you can visit it here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience. There\u0026rsquo;s also a live survey for suggestions about the project: http://bit.ly/AutisticaTuring-OnlineForm And you can sign up to the mailing list here: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience  Questions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Isla is in the midst of writing her dissertation, and is wondering how to pinpoint the right level of detail needed. Because she’s used to sharing knowledge and making things clear [🧡 \u0026ndash;Ed], it can be hard to work out the right level of explanation for other experts. A top tip for writing from Sarah is to start with bullet points and then build up a path of what else needs explaining.\nGeorgia wants to know how to help people help each other in the lab meetings. There were lots of great ideas, ranging from focusing on technical challenges that are more common across projects, which solves the problem of members of the group not having the same domain expertise, to working on a specific project together to build up those skills. Having a very specific project to work on together can make the time really focused and valuable. The research engineering team run tech talks to share some of their skills, and maybe some of the weeks could include working through a small problem together.\nSarah Wants tips on working on a project if the content is overwhelming (a.k.a anyone familiar with Guassian Processes? 😅)\nKirstie has been thinking a lot about the need for trust in communities – specifically, that we need to trust each other to be able to ask each other questions. She\u0026rsquo;s been thinking about what the barriers to trust are in the group are. She’d love to know what has worked in the past to build a supportive team and environment. We discussed whether shyneess or lack of self-confidence could be treated using exposure therapy, and Sarah suggested that a good way to strike a balance is to find a friendly audience to start with (but definitely not to avoid speaking or assertion entirely).\nWe also discussed the Binder community and what makes it supportive. According to Sarah, it helps to have EMOJIS!!! ✨ 💖 😃 Also, never missing an opportunity to remind people they\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job helps. This is very important in the Binder community because they\u0026rsquo;re so distributed.\nGeorgia would like ideas about the best ways of learning physics! Sarah recommended looking at science videos on YouTube. There are also fun experiments that you can do yourself at home, for example experimenting with static electricity using balloons. So much better than dry manuals 🙄\nCheck out: 👇\n https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kurzgesagt  (Or find someone who’s a physicist and ask them to explain directly)    Isla gave this awesome (wise) advice: You start learning about physics when you\u0026rsquo;re a baby when you pick things up and drop them to see what happens – carry on with this attitude. Stay curious! 👶 👩 👵\nAnything else We also had a general discussion about astrophysics, maths, and academia. Academia can feel like SHOUTING into the void (but you are making the domain of humanity\u0026rsquo;s knowledge a little larger, which is kinda cool).\nWe discussed the fact that academic conferences can be brutal, and how we deal with it. Many people have problems because of their own biases, which it\u0026rsquo;s important to bear this in mind. Sarah shared the top tip that you\u0026rsquo;ll often get people wanting to share their experience more than hear your thoughts. You can always reply with \u0026ldquo;I think that\u0026rsquo;s more of a comment than a question\u0026rdquo; and move swiftly on 😏.\nIsla pointed out the most important thing is to BE KIND: being kind and listening can be disarming and a good strategy for dealing with criticism 💞\n","href":"/blog/2019-08-01-lab-meeting/","title":"Lab Meeting on 01 August 2019"},{"content":"This week\u0026rsquo;s meeting was jaaaaaam packed!\nKeep reading to learn about some of the fun things that folks are celebrating and thinking about and scroll to all the pictures at the end to see some fantastic updates from the lab projects.\nCelebrations and cool things to share Kirstie kicked off the celebrations with a laundry list of items!\n The existence of the first lab meeting blog post. The video of her keynote talk at PyData London from a couple of weeks ago (and the playlist for all the other talks). A heads up that the deadline for poster submissions to the Cambridge Neuroscience Seminar on Artificial and Biological Cognition is coming up fast on 2 August. A lot of excitement for submitting her first ever grant (with James Hetherington as the lead investigator). And finally, a whole lot of love for Serena Williams in this fun video.  Maxine is having fun writing up her PhD - and not in a sarcastic way! She\u0026rsquo;s really loving knitting everything together.\nPatricia ran a really successful Friendly Introduction to GitHub session which went really well.\nSarah is working on \u0026ldquo;defending her time\u0026rdquo; because she\u0026rsquo;s finding it too distracting being at her desk with lots of interesting ideas around her. The sitting alone in a room with a calendar booking that said \u0026ldquo;Hacking on Binderhub\u0026rdquo; seemed to work pretty well!\nGeorgia (and Kirstie) are really excited to have received another piece of paperwork that takes us one more step closer to being able to publicly collaborate on designing the Autistica/Turing citizen science platform. Any day now 🤞🤞\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Kirstie is thinking about how to make it easy for folks to share their expertise with each other.\nSome ideas that came from discussion before and during the meeting are:\n Have a lab member present their project and then work together on that one to learn more about it. Give an \u0026ldquo;introduction to my subject\u0026rdquo; session to get folks up to speed on the necessary background knowledge. Recognise that everyone can share some skills, and that while a project may not look smilar from the outside, there are a lot of aspects of open science, open source development, reproducible research, and open, kind and collaborative working that are shared across them all.  Patricia is curious about what folks think about the current discussions in the library community about teaching via games, for example at this upcoming event. Let her know if you think it would be fun, silly, off putting or engaging!\nAlex asked about tailoring a presentation to different audiences. The general take home message is to adapt the background and introduction slides depending on the group you\u0026rsquo;re presenting to. Kirstie pointed out that neuroscience audiences in particular tend to come from a lot of different backgrounds so getting everyone on the same page is really important. She also noted that almost no-one is paying attention for all of your talk 😭. So putting some effort into bringing folks back to the story when you\u0026rsquo;ve lost them (eg 1/3 and 2/3 of the way through the presentation) is really helpful!\nGeorgia is learning python and looking for folks to learn with too. Sarah has linked her up with the Turing Research Engineering code club and recommended Rosetta Code as an interesting resource.\nAng is curious about resources for getting started with open science. And in particular how to make it easy for different groups with different expertise or who use different languages (human and computer!) to work together. The group recommended the Open Research chapter of the Turing Way, and the reading list in the Whitaker Lab onboarding repository.\nA general update For this meeting, everyone was asked to share one powerpoint slide about work that you\u0026rsquo;re doing that is of interest to the lab.\nHere they are!\nLouise Bowler   Elizabeth DuPre   Sarah Gibson   Patricia Herterich   Isla Staden   Yo Yehudi   Georgia Aitkenhead   Yini He   Ang Li   Whew!

Everyone (not just lab members) is welcome to brainstorm together in in our gitter room.\nCelebrations and cool things to share Kirstie wrote a little blog post for Sky News about Alan Turing being on the £50 note.\nThe piece closes with the following call to action:\n Alan Turing will now become the iconic face of the £50 note. But he also represents everyone who has served their country, those giants of science on whose shoulders we now stand, and all people who have been - and continue to be - denied their human rights.\nI look to Alan Turing both as a role model to inspire new and creative research questions and as motivation to keep fighting for equity and justice for all marginalised members of our society. In his own words: \u0026ldquo;We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.\u0026quot;\n Sarah\u0026rsquo;s got herself into an infinite loop of building cool bots to do her work for her 😂\nPatricia is wrapping up her current job and getting ready for new adventures. But before she goes she\u0026rsquo;ll run a \u0026ldquo;Friendly GitHub\u0026rdquo; workshop (inspired by this one) for library colleagues next week.\nLouise has been learning about scientific file formats and how to improve them by learning from database design expertise. Kirstie recommended that Louise (and everyone!) should checkout Saul Pwanson\u0026rsquo;s amazing talk at csv,conf,v4 on \u0026ldquo;How a File Format Led to a Crossword Scandal\u0026rdquo;. You can see all the csv,conf talks online at this YouTube playlist.\nGeorgia has built a demo for the Autistica/Citizen science platform! In fact she and Bastian did it in one day!! 🙀🚀🌟 Thank you Bastian for going through all the steps with her.\nBastian and Kirstie recommend the Flat earth documentary \u0026ldquo;Behind the Curve\u0026rdquo; as a fascinating investigation of the importance of community.\nQuestions we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about Kirstie is - kinda like always - wondering about the best way to communicate and share skills with the group. There are so much expertise in the group but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel from her (my - I\u0026rsquo;m writing the blog post 😂) that folks are learning from each other. Suggestions always welcome!\nGeorgia is curious about whether anyone has expertise in communicating agency and consent online, and how to make conducting scientific research in an inclusive and clear way.\nLouise has been interviewing lots of people for the research engineering team (with other members of REG, not by herself!) She\u0026rsquo;s wondering if there are \u0026ldquo;easy wins\u0026rdquo; to include in the process, or pitfalls to avoid!\nYo is looking for recommendations for transcribing a different type of interview - research interviews - because at the moment it\u0026rsquo;s painfully slow 😩\nVisiting Speaker: Bastian Greshake Tzvoras We were so delighted to welcome Bastian to lab meeting today. He\u0026rsquo;s been working with Kirstie and Georgia this week on the Autistica/Turing citizen science project (which still doesn\u0026rsquo;t have its insurance certificate so isn\u0026rsquo;t public yet 😭).\nHe presented about his work with Open Humans: a platform that allows anyone to upload, connect, and privately store their personal data. Once someone\u0026rsquo;s added the data, they can choose to donate it, either publicly or as part of a research project. They\u0026rsquo;re working to turn the traditional research pipeline on its head, putting the data owner at the center and in control of when and with whom they share their data. (This paragraph was adapted from the Open Humans about page.)\n  Overview of Open Humans, linked from their about page.   Check out the footer of his website to see some of the personal data tracking in action!\nBastian\u0026rsquo;s work for Open Humans grew from his creation of Open SNP during his PhD. (In fact, his genome data is available as the very first user of the platform!)\nBeyond \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; sharing data, Bastian is really interested in open governance structures and how communities can make decisions equitably together. We - Kirstie at least - learned the word \u0026ldquo;produsage\u0026rdquo; during his talk. The concept is similar and related to commons-based peer production and both capture ideas of user-led content creation and monitoring.\nBastian be working for the next three years as a research fellow at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) in Paris from September 2019.

My research interests include data ethics and the philosophy of technology. I’m currently building a citizen science platform and developing a participatory science framework.\nBefore joining the Turing I was a civil servant, and I studied English literature for my undergrad and M.Phil degrees.\nI am open to collaborating and am interested in helping out with projects and papers – so get in touch if you’d like to join forces!\nWhere I\u0026rsquo;m From   I’m from a tiny town in the Scottish Borders called Lauder. There aren’t that many people there, but there’s lots of trees, sheep, and rain. If you like rolling emerald hills and can tolerate numberless midges and never-ending mud, I’d recommend a visit!\nHere I am as a tiny kid (the horse’s name is Godiva \u0026lt;3) – I was too young to form any memories of this moment, so I don’t know if I was happy or terrified :p\n  I’ve spent most of my adult life in London, but I’ve also lived in Oxford (where I did my undergrad) and Cambridge (for my M.Phil), as well as in Paris and Beijing. I can tell I’ve lost my Scottish stoicism because I like my porridge with hot cream and strawberries instead of cold water. Still undecided on whether I prefer a dry martini, dry socks, and dry humour to a hot toddy, damp boots, and Braveheart references though.\nI have a twin sister who\u0026rsquo;s a professional pianist in Edinburgh. Like all twins, we share not only genes but dreams, and we have telepathic powers. Here she is playing:\n  What I Like and Motivations Music: I play saxophone and I love jazz, especially Charlie Parker. I could easily go crazy listening to Crazeology on loop forever if friends didn\u0026rsquo;t intervene.\nRunning: Just for the endorphins! I’m not especially disciplined or competitive.\nReading!!!!!!! I\u0026rsquo;m a greedy omnivore who appreciates both books and computers.\n This looks dangerous - full disclosure I've never risked this level of efficiency! Image comes from www.saltyrunning.com/readers-roundtable-read-run   Learning - I’m very excited to be at the Turing and to be able to develop skills and encounter new ideas! I’ve already had lots of warm welcoming, interesting discussions, mentoring, and support – thanks everyone.\nI care about inclusivity – in science, in tech, and in general. I believe that everyone should be empowered to reach their potential, and that progress for us all depends on it. One of my motivations is to make sure all the work I do here at the Turing (and in life) reflects that as much as I can.\n(I also really like Grace Hopper\u0026rsquo;s cartoons of software bugs):\n Image from Smithsonian Image Archive  Thanks for reading!

I am joining the Whitaker Lab as a part of the Google Summer of Code program. My interests for computer science are very recent - a year ago, I had wanted to be a surgeon! I have discovered so many useful computer science applications for the medical field. Through working with the tedana library, I hope to assist in denoising fMRI data, and dive deeper into the real life applications of CS! Outside of the combinations of CS + medicine, I am also very interested in computer systems engineering!\nDuring my free time, I like to explore trendy food places and take pictures of them (I need to learn how to edit photos though)!\n  Here are some of the recent food pictures I took!   Hometown I lived in Shenzhen, a city in China that connects Hong Kong and the mainland, for 8 years. I then moved to the states. Specifically, I moved to the Bay Area into the San Mateo district. The location was wonderful, as it was close to both San Francisco and San Jose, and there is a vast array of places to be explored.\n  This picture was taken by my friend when we visited the beautiful Moraga Steps in San Francisco!   Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Why GSoC? Open source is intimidating - especially for someone who has never helped develop a product used by others. What if something breaks and I\u0026rsquo;m responsible for that? (Of course, there are code reviews\u0026hellip; but still!) GSoC enables me to make a contribution to open source world. The program is amazing in that I am paired up with mentors, and could connect to a community that will actively help.\nI am in awe of contributors who dive into the world themselves, but I am thankful for GSoC in that I will be guided along the way.\nNonetheless, I am ready to learn from this experience and become a regular contributor in the open source world!\nWhy tedana and what do I want to achieve? I am excited about helping tedana because it is a very small, personal project. The science and process behind it is very specific (and difficult to understand). The reason why I chose tedana is because I have always been practicing Test-Driven Development whether in school or in my own projects, and utilizing the skills in the real world, on an actual library, is something I wanted to experience.\nI have taken multiple machine learning classes, and reading about the progress in machine learning in medical imaging piqued my interests in the other steps of the pipeline. How does one make sure that the data fed into machine learning is good, with no noise?\nThat is exactly what tedana does! tedana denoises the data from multi-echo fMRI, and produces clean data that is useful for statistical analysis. Of course, this will be helpful for neuroscientists, but it is also a step for analyzing medical data with machine learning (which is groundbreaking).\nFrom this summer, I wish to achieve a couple of things:\n Learn about the awesome and neat science behind multi-echo fMRI How this library could be advanced in the future, should there be a new publication about denoising ME fMRI data Adding lots and lots of tests to the library so that contributors in the future could extend the library without worries Familiarizing myself with open source, and continue adding onto libraries as a regular contributor!  ","href":"/blog/2019-05-21-monicas-introduction/","title":"Google Summer of Code - Monica's Introduction"},{"content":"TL;DR  My name is Ruslan Yermakov, I am a senior undergraduate student with a major in Computer Science at Sumy State University, Ukraine. I find it so hard to put into words how much I am enthusiastic to be accepted as a Google Summer of Code student and excited to become a member of the Whitaker lab research group and to contribute to the scona project, an open-source toolkit for neuroscientists! My interests include data visualization, data science, neuroscience and design of intelligent algorithms and systems.\n Why scona and neuroscience? Being initiative and enterprising, I am always willing to learn new things and look for new ideas. I value self-development and consider education to be the best investment. Based on the Coursera’s recommendation once I’ve decided to complete the online course “Learning how to learn” (the best ever course) presented by Dr. Barbara Oakley. This is how I have got excited about neuroscience field. What I liked the most, all the tips and suggestions of how to “learn smart not hard” were backed up by insightful facts and recent researches, that inform about the way our brain works, which is helpful for improving one\u0026rsquo;s productivity. That’s why the chance to apply my knowledge and skills to develop the tool for neuroscientist was so appealing to me.\nFrom the list of INCF’s projects, scona project grabbed my attention the most. It matches my previous experience and skills as well as my interests. I especially appreciated the chance to contribute to the python project (love Python) that has great potential to be used by many people. In short, I just felt that this project was right for me.\nSome more interests In order to gain practical experience, in March 2018 I moved to Germany to work at SAP SE as a Software Engineer Intern for the following 6 months. During my internship, I was working on the integration of Google Service - BigQuery into SAP DataHub (BigData platform). To complete the task I developed new components (operators) in Python, covered code with unit tests and made well-written documentation. While working with teammates and mentors on the project, I became familiar with the collaborative workflow and agile software development.\nI am a happy dog owner, football-addicted (once red, forever red), constantly broadening my outlook by engaging in exciting discussions about the meaning of life and if a hotdog is a sandwich. I am interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, new advancements and achievements in hightech. Love reading and hearing awesome stories and points of views from interesting people (Elon Musk is not the only one).\n  Waiting for the summer with my buddy   What\u0026rsquo;s next First things first, over the summer I plan to achieve the goals and ideas I mentioned in my proposal for the project. While contributing and working on scona I personally want to hone my programming skills and put my problem-solving skills to the next level. In addition, I would like to help to grow a community around the scona package.\nAs per my future plans, I plan to have my Master’s studies at a nice university with the major in Data Science. Most of all what I appreciate about Computer Science and programming is the way it enables people to bring their ideas to life and solve the problems our community faces. I also like to work on real-life projects and see the outcomes of my efforts that have influence business and society. That’s why my Master’s Degree I decided to have in Data Science, as I believe this field fits my interests at best. Interacting and collaborating with people from The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, will be incredibly beneficial and valuable for my future. While applying I did not know that project is within a lab at the Turing Institute though. What a great coincidence!\nI am delighted of being able to contribute to such a meaningful project, become a member of the Whitaker lab research group and be part of the vast community of INCF organization. Looking forward to the great summer!\n  With the World Cup last summer.

My current research interests include neuroscience, genetics, neuroimaging and artistic data visualization, and understanding or building biomarkers for mental disorders.\n   I like challenges but sometimes I also need a man to kick my ass behind. (Picuture taken at Huairou District of Beijing in 2016)   Hometown My hometown is a small city called ‘Hegang’, located at Northeast of China and adjoins Russia. In winter, it is an ice wonderland, fully of beautiful snow and rime, and people like having ice-suckers even when it’s minus thirty degrees outside. Please don’t think that people from cold regions are cold resistant. On the contrary, people in south China can endure more cold as they don’t have heating system inside their houses. As for us, in winter we sometimes open our windows to cool off as the central heating is so …! (heating system is usually not intelligent but powerful in my hometown)\n  My hometown (the photo from internet (https://so.vjshi.com/889403.html))   Previous experences During my university period, I majored in automation at Harbin Institute of Technology, where I skipped most of classes because I was doing so many other fun things 😬! I and my friend rent a house to set up a recording studio and I was in charge of producing MTV. In my holiday, I did a part-time job as the figurant in Hendian, the biggest cinema city in China, just attempted to watch how they professionally shoot videos. But after carrying on several advertising films, I realized that I shouldn’t regard video producing as my vocation, as the business often comes first than art and creativity.\nI love music, including rock and roll, folk rhyme and pop music. One of my favorite rock band is MISERABLE FAITH and I used the symbol of this band as the head portrait in my social-media account. It encouraged me that one should raise his head and never compromise to difficulties. Also, I listened folk songs everyday, it gave me a place to release all my stress and Bi Cheng is one of my favoriate.\n  2017 New Year’s Eve concert of Bi Cheng, a folk singer in China. (Photo taken by me at Hangzhou in 2017)   Fish in scientific research Then my interest fell into mental disorder and brain science after watching some related films and TED lectures. I’m very fortunate to meet and know my current Chinese supervisor Prof. Bing Liu . She’s a very kind and talented scientist and gave me a unique opportunity to do scientific research. In China, we did an interesting and meaningful research that developing a novel imaging biomarker for schizophrenia by using machine learning technologies and large-sample case-control datasets, which can potentially help future diagnosis, medication and pathological studies.\n  Curiosity for Brain (Drawed at Harbin in 2015).   Fish in Turing Here in London, although my journey just began, I found Kirstie very nice and aspiring and it also seems a wonderful place to engage in scientific research. I hope we can together make some fantastic findings in the field of neurodevelopment and I’m really excited to learn knowledge of open science from her.

It\u0026rsquo;s a day where the whole senior school (11-18) and the oldest members of the junior school come together to celebrate everything that the girls in the school have achieved over the last year.\n The choirs and orchestra were wonderful. This is during their performance of a medley of music from The Greatest Showman 😍  Writing the speech I attended Withington Girls' School from 1992 to 2001. It\u0026rsquo;s a highly selective private school - I had to take an entrance exam aged 9 and another aged 11. And my family paid a lot of money for me to go there for those nine years.\nThe first version of my talk was approximately 4 hours long. I had so many things to say to the students.\nI wanted to talk about the fact that by going to an all girls school I was protected from (perceived) misogyny until I was 29 years old. (When it did happen it was so stereotypical it was laughable - I said something in a meeting and a man re-stated it 5 minutes later to great appreciation from the rest of the group. It was the first, but not the last, time this happened.)\nI wanted to tell them about the incredibly valuable conversations I\u0026rsquo;ve had with my friends about my wealth privilege. I never thought of my family as rich when I was growing up, but we certainly never worried about where rent or our meals were going to come from, and I\u0026rsquo;ve always been protected from the stresses that those worries bring.\nI wanted to describe all the \u0026ldquo;extra-curricular\u0026rdquo; activities I\u0026rsquo;ve done in my life. To show them that a female physicist can teach dance for kids at Stagecoach theatre school, play in the orchestra, sing in the choir, perform Shakespeare, play for sports teams, run a hall of residence bar, coordinate a student ski and board club, raise money for HIV/AIDS by riding 545 miles every year, teach dogs how to search for hidden scents, demonstrate how an MRI machine works to teenagers, their teachers and policy makers, and so much more.\nI wanted to tell them how my friends came to take care of me and my 8 week old puppy when my boyfriend died on Mount Shasta in 2010. How they\u0026rsquo;ve always taken care of me, and still do take care of me in my hardest times. How international friendships will be as strong as family ties because you have to find your support network when you\u0026rsquo;re so far from home.\nBut, I only had 7 minutes. So what follows are the most important points that I could find to speak to me of 18 years ago.\n(For it to make sense, you need to know that I\u0026rsquo;ve just presented each of the upper sixth - the oldest girls in the school - with a commemorative book that they\u0026rsquo;d chosen.)\nFounders Day Speech 2018   These books are so inspirational!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t really mean that the books are inspirational. I mean that the women who just walked across this stage are inspirational. Thank you for showing me a little window into who you are. Thank you for showing me how diverse and eclectic you all are.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another book here. It\u0026rsquo;s my book, that I received when I walked across this stage in 2000. It\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;ICONS OF THE 20TH CENTURY: 200 men and women who made a difference\u0026rdquo;. And it\u0026rsquo;s really heavy, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to put it down 😉\nI always used to get bored in Founders Day speeches. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever paid attention to one of them - we always used to count the organ pipes to try to stay awake - so I can\u0026rsquo;t really expect you to stay awake!\nJust in case you nod off while I\u0026rsquo;m speaking, here are the two points I want you to remember:\n You must dream. It\u0026rsquo;s ok for those dreams to change.  And - if you\u0026rsquo;re still with me - I guess there\u0026rsquo;s also a third:\nBe gentle with yourself.  I\u0026rsquo;m going to read to you from my Fulbright application. The Fulbright fellowship is an international exchange scholarship between the US and the rest of the world. It\u0026rsquo;s designed to foster global understanding and collaboration. This is my application to be a scholar in the USA from the UK:\n While many physicists of my generation have grown up believing that the investigation of space is the \u0026ldquo;final frontier\u0026rdquo;, I have come to believe that the most demanding area of research is much closer to home. It was through our observations of the stars and analysis of their radiation that quantum mechanics and particle physics came to be thoroughly modelled and understood, and through the applications of these branches of physics magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography arose. These techniques have revolutionised our ability to look inside ourselves and understand the 100 billion neurons in the brain, their 100 trillion connections and the near infinite number of paths along which a neuronal signal may pass. Put simply, I believe that the greatest challenge is presented to the scientific community in our drive to understand ourselves.\n That sounds quite impressive, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?! A bit cheesy, and the sentences are too long, but quite impressive?\nIt sounds like I had a plan. A bit of a grandiose plan, but a plan nonetheless.\nI did not.\nI wrote that lying on my couch in Vancouver at 2am with a friend in Australia editing it for me.\nAs a side note, one of the good things about having friends all over the world is that someone is always awake when you need them to edit your last minute scholarship application!\nI did get that fellowship - thank you Allanah - and was headed off to Berkeley.\nIt sounds like I had a plan.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll say it again. I did not.\nI\u0026rsquo;d gone to study Physics at Bristol because there was a cute boy who showed me around on the interview day.\nI\u0026rsquo;d gone to study Medical Physics at the University of British Columbia because I wanted to ski. (And I did in fact ski so much that it took me 3 years to complete a 2 year master programme.)\nAnd now I was off to study Neuroscience at UC Berkeley, in California, just outside of San Francisco.\nI loved what I learned about Neuroscience, but more importantly I loved the people that I met. UC Berkeley is very proud of its history as a hub of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. And it\u0026rsquo;s close enough to Silicon Valley to have an entrepreneurial \u0026ldquo;we can do it\u0026rdquo; mindset.\nSo that meant I was surrounded by smart, intelligent, passionate people who all wanted to change the world. To make a difference.\nI came back to the UK in 2012 looking to apply what I knew about Neuroscience to the adolescent brain. I work in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. And I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in why teenagers are so at risk of developing mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety or schizophrenia.\nBut I knew that there are lots of aspects of our lives that affect our mental health, so - on another whim - I applied to work at the Alan Turing Institute: the UK\u0026rsquo;s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.\n(It sounds like it was all part of a plan. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t. I promise.)\nI work with neuroscientists and physicists at the Turing. But I also work with mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, social scientists, political scientists, linguists, historians and philosophers. I work with the education team, the IT team and the communications team.\nIn fact one of my tasks today was to sign off on the stories that are going to be published tomorrow as part of our celebrations of Ada Lovelace Day.\nAnd if you don\u0026rsquo;t know who Ada Lovelace is, she\u0026rsquo;s the first computer programmer. Not the first female computer programmer. The first computer programmer.\nAnd so that leads me to my dream. My dream of 2018. The current dream.\nI want all voices to be heard. I want every academic discipline to work together to change the world. I want all lived experiences considered and acknowledged.\nI want to hear\n female voices black and minority ethnic voices disabled voices neurodiverse voices queer voices muslim and jewish voices, voices of all the world\u0026rsquo;s religions and in every language the world contains.  I want a wildly intersectional understanding of our world.\nAnd more importantly - I don\u0026rsquo;t want to just hear those voices. I want those voices to be leading me. I want them to shape the conversations we have in data science, neuroscience, physics, biology, the arts and humanities, politics, international relations, health care, finance, the law and beyond.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a big dream. And it\u0026rsquo;s overwhelming. Honestly, on a day-to-day basis, I still have no real clue what I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m here from the future to tell you that no one knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nBut ultimately I\u0026rsquo;m working on my dream. I\u0026rsquo;m taking tiny baby steps towards my dream.\nAnd I know it\u0026rsquo;s intimidating to be told that you have to make a difference. But you do. And you will.\nSo rely on your friends. Take inspiration from them. Travel the world to find your tribe.\nReinvent yourself when you need to.\nAnd take care of yourself.\nAnd you can try to be part of the ICONS OF THE 21st CENTURY edition of this book. Or you can just be pleased that you quietly made a difference.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t let anyone stand in your way. And try your best not to stand in your own way.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll finish with a quote from Alan Turing.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m speaking to the misfits. To the people who don\u0026rsquo;t know where they\u0026rsquo;re going or what they\u0026rsquo;re going to be when they grow up.\nI\u0026rsquo;m speaking to you.\n \u0026ldquo;Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of, who do the things no one can imagine.\u0026rdquo;\n Thank you.\nThank you  I want to give a huge shout out to my parents who came along to hear me speak. They supported me throughout my school years and my various degrees, and they were so proud yesterday. It really made a wonderful day particularly special.\nAnd - most importantly - thank you to all the girls who came up to me afterwards to thank me for the speech.

So in the spirit of \u0026ldquo;blog post or it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen\u0026rdquo; here are my thoughts on citing works in progress.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re working under an open licence, anyone can use anything you\u0026rsquo;ve done I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of working open (check out this video of Mozilla Excecutive Director Mark Surman describing the concept if you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard of it before).\nIn particular I really love the idea of being able to ask for and receive help while you\u0026rsquo;re in the process of building your tool, conducting your analyses, or writing that paper. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a radically collaborative way of sharing knowledge and so much more efficient than our current system of \u0026ldquo;keep everything closed until it\u0026rsquo;s a perfect finished product\u0026rdquo;.\n(Bearing in mind that there almost never *is* a perfect finished product!)\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s really fascinating though is to think about how to give credit for those ideas. Your open licence (MIT, BSD or Apache for example) allows people to re-use whatever they find in your GitHub repository so long as they credit you.\nBut what if you\u0026rsquo;re not done yet? The specific example that came up on the last day of Neurohackademy was this tweet in response to my thread about the Open Science Factor (O-Factor) project.\nReally cool! I\u0026#39;d like to cite it. Could you please ask the authors to put the results/graphs in a PDF somewhere with a persistent identifier (e.g., OSF)? And/or please include contact info on the page.\n\u0026mdash; Steve Haroz (@sharoz) August 11, 2018  The project is really cool. As they say in their README file:\n The goal of the project is to give journals (but in the future also papers, and importantly, scientists) a score of how \u0026ldquo;open science\u0026rdquo; they are. We want to find a way to promote open science and give incentives for scientists and journals to do and support more open science.\n The team did an incredible job over the four days of the hackathon and presented some lovely figures. These results aren\u0026rsquo;t double checked and the scientists in the team knew that. Their presentation came with a strongly disclaimer that the results were pulled together over just a few days and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be taken as a final product.\nBut they\u0026rsquo;re up on GitHub and they have an open licence! Can someone use them?! Can they be cited? Should they?\nYes they can\u0026hellip;with appropriate documentation There are at least two ways that someone might want to cite the O-Factor project right now.\n The idea is freaking cool and someone wants to promote it. There\u0026rsquo;s a figure they want to interpret.  The first is really important to me. This is the point of working open. There\u0026rsquo;s no need for individual teams to keep their ideas secret for fear of scooping: we all want to see these stats! Why would we keep these initiatives secret?\nMy personal recommendation to the O-Factor team is that they make a release and archive it in Zenodo so that they have a DOI and a timestamp of what they did together at Neurohackademy (following this guide). I\u0026rsquo;d probably call it v0.0.1 as it\u0026rsquo;s right at the very start of the project 😸\nBut before they do, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend adding a sentence or two that conveys how confident they are in the contents of the repository. How reliable are the graphs? Do they need more work? Are there open issues to consider?\nThe goal of this caveat is not to undermine the work they\u0026rsquo;ve done, but to be responsible about what can and can not be extrapolated from their work.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s entirely up to them to determine whether the figures are interpretable (point 2 above) or not. But I would really like for our open science allies around the world to be able to give credit to the team for their idea and the process they developed.\n(Update: the team did an amazing job adding this information to their README, it looks awesome! Check it out at https://github.com/srcole/o-factor 🙌)\n The open science factor team at Neurohackademy 2018.  tl;dr  Share your work as you go along so you aren\u0026rsquo;t reinventing the wheel! Make it easy for people to give you credit for your work (your ideas, your code and/or your results). Get yourself a DOI and make sure everyone\u0026rsquo;s names are in the metadata. Add an example sentence to your README file showing how someone can cite that DOI. Add clear and prominent sentences to the README about what can and can not at this stage be concluded from the work.  Basically I\u0026rsquo;m saying: put into accessible form, clearly linking to the content of the repository, what the project\u0026rsquo;s licence already says:\n [the work] is distributed on an \u0026ldquo;AS IS\u0026rdquo; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND\n ","href":"/blog/2018-08-11-citing-wips/","title":"Citing works in progress"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/github/","title":"github"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/open-science/","title":"open-science"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/open-source/","title":"open-source"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/zenodo/","title":"zenodo"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/alan-turing/","title":"alan-turing"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/data-science/","title":"data-science"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/diversity/","title":"diversity"},{"content":"Hi everyone! Here are my slides from my Lunch and Learn event today, hosted by the Macquarie Group Pride network. They represent my opinions and not (necessarily) those of the Turing or Macquarie Group (although I hope there\u0026rsquo;s at least some overlap here!)\n I was asked to speak about the Life and legacy of Alan Turing and my talk has been heavily inspired by a fantastic panel discussion that I took part in last summer. Hosted by the British Library as part of their GAY UK exhibition, I shared a stage with Prof Andrew Hodges (the man who literally wrote the book on Turing\u0026rsquo;s life) and Sir John Dermot Turing (Alan Turing\u0026rsquo;s nephew) - discussed his life and particularly put it in the context of the laws criminalising homosexuality of the time.\nAlthough I\u0026rsquo;ll include some facts about Turing\u0026rsquo;s life in my talk today, I want to acknowledge that I\u0026rsquo;m mostly parroting Andrew and Dermot\u0026rsquo;s expertise from that fantastic conversation, along with everything I learned at my excellent birthday trip to Bletchley Park last year!\nMy role on the British Library panel was to represent the Turing Institute and current working data scientists, and my talk today does exactly that. Importantly I\u0026rsquo;ll cover some key reasons that although homosexuality is no longer illegal in the UK, we still need better representation in data science and artificial intelligence.\nI\u0026rsquo;m the chair of the Turing Ethics Advisory Group and one of the key areas of focus for many of us at the Turing is making sure that technology is built by representative communities. To quote my friend Teon Brooks (co-founder of the fantastic Queer Hack):\n \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t need a diversity committee, if you have a diverse committee.\u0026rdquo;\n My talk covers some examples of major data science fails:\n This racist soap dispenser that Chukwuemeka Afigbo has to trick into recognising his black skin. The fact that a white journalist can\u0026rsquo;t beat the iPhone X face ID algorithm but two Chinese women are apparently interchangeable. Researchers at Stamford thought that it would be a good idea to use deep learning to predict whether someone is straight or gay.  That last one is particularly appropriate for a talk during LGBT history month. It\u0026rsquo;s wrong in a bunch of different ways: the experimental psychologist in me is horrified by the terrible study design, the training I\u0026rsquo;ve received in experiments on human subjects screams out that the participants did not give informed consent, and - maybe most importantly - this is an example of a new technology that can very easily be appropriated to harm LGBTQ+ people.\nI work with Josh Cowls who wrote this excellent blog post on AI\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Trolley Problem\u0026rdquo; Problem. I\u0026rsquo;m including it in this talk to highlight the question of who is responsible for ensuring the safety of new technology? In the case of self driving cars, is it the company who builds them? The people who write the algorithm? Governments? Activists? You?\nThe larger point I\u0026rsquo;m making is that we need to be building technology, or conducting research that is by the people for the people. I hope that Alan Turing inspires many LGBTQ+ people to achieve their goals in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM) and beyond. But as we progress it is imperative that we look around and consider whose voices are left out of our conversations? Are we supporting people who lie at the intersections of traditionally underrepresented groups? How can we build inclusive communities, together?\nSome useful links A very non-comprehensive list of references for people wanting to know more and spread the word:\n A wonderful collection of talks at OpenCon 2017 on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Open Research and Open Education Scientific American special report on how diversity empowers science and innovation: www.scientificamerican.com/report/how-diversity-empowers-science-and-innovation  Including this article on how diversity makes us smarter: www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter   The Alan Turing Institute home page: www.turing.ac.uk Details about the Macquarie Group\u0026rsquo;s commitment to diversity and inclusion: www.macquarie.com/uk/about/careers/articles/diversity Details about the ongoing University and College Union (UCU) strike: www.ucu.org.uk/strikeforuss The visit us page at Bletchley Park because you totally should go! bletchleypark.org.uk/visit-us My fundraising page for AIDS/Lifecycle 2018 if you fancy supporting the SF AIDS Foundation and the LA LGBT Center: tofighthiv.org/goto/kirstie  My slides are licensed CC-BY which means you can use them (and remix them) for anything you\u0026rsquo;d like so long as you credit me.

No. I don\u0026rsquo;t really address the ethical challenges of open science in this article. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to say about them, but maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll save those for another day.)\nI\u0026rsquo;m delighted to have been featured in this blog post - I\u0026rsquo;m in exceptional company with some of the most established leaders of open science practices in Neuroimaging. If you don\u0026rsquo;t already know Adam Thomas, Russ Poldrack, Jeanette Mumford, Niko Kriegeskorte and Lara Boyd you should definitely go and read the blog to find out more.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve copied and pasted my section below, but first I\u0026rsquo;ll highlight the thing I\u0026rsquo;m most proud of. The picture that accompanies the blog was made by Robin Champieux and beautifully visualises the different aspects of open science (or open research if we wanted to be even more inclusive). I may be the one quoted in the blog as explaining these different facets of open science, but I\u0026rsquo;ve learned them all from the wonderful OpenCon and Mozilla Science communities. Thank you to Robin, Olivia Guest, Penny Andrews and Danielle Robinson (among so many others) for teaching me so much. 🙌💖🎉\n Open science is more than open source or open access. I love how clearly Robin outlines these overlapping but distinct aspects of open science practices.  My quote in the article Change is coming. Before we continue, let’s define some terms for potential readers: open science is an umbrella term that can mean different things to different people. Open access research allows everyone to learn from scientific work (particularly that paid for by the tax payer). Open educational resources mean we don’t re-invent the wheel when we teach others about our work. Open source materials are ones that allow you to see inside, and improve, the black box. Open data allows researchers to verify our work, and conduct analyses that could not be carried out by one group alone.\nOpen science also means open to everyone. We can use the power of curious non-experts through Citizen Science projects. The Open Neuroimaging Laboratory was a finalist for the Open Science Prize and sought to \u0026ldquo;lower the barriers for researchers, students, and citizen scientists to help scientific discovery\u0026rdquo;. We can look to other neuroscience projects such as Eye Wire and FoldIt for inspiration in the future.\nFinally, open science means open for all. Whose voices are not currently represented well in our field of study? Who is not advancing to tenured positions? How do we ensure that researchers in the developing world are able to contribute to our quest to understand the human brain? All of the open practices above facilitate the inclusion of under-represented minorities, but it will require ongoing focus and consideration to create an equitable community. That’s my biggest challenge: addressing my implicit (and explicit) biases to ensure we have bigger, better and more diverse ideas in the future.\nI would like to live in a world where helping to advance the boundary of scientific knowledge is rewarded through new findings and by confirming (or not) already published results irrespective of who owns the data.\nThank you David and Kevin It takes a lot of work to wrangle six different academics! Thank you David and Kevin for bringing this piece together and framing it with such a lovely introduction. I\u0026rsquo;ve copied and pasted this information about them from the blog post so my readers know just who you both are ☺️\n David Mehler is an MD/PhD student at Cardiff University (UK) and the University of Muenster (Germany).

Last Wednesday 10th January I was delighted to take part in a panel discussion after they showed The Imitation Game as part of the Science on Screen film festival.\n  The Imitation Game tells the story of Alan Turing who worked to break the German Enigma machine at Bletchley Park during World War II. It also highlights his death by suicide in 1954 after undergoing chemical castration as punishment for being gay.\nThe film is loosely based on Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges but one of the first points we made in our panel discussion was to highlight a few of the inaccuracies that have been introduced by dramatising the story of Turing\u0026rsquo;s life. It\u0026rsquo;s my personal opinion that inspiring people to learn more about Alan Turing (and having a very engaging film going experience!) is worth some of these errors\u0026hellip;but I really encourage you to understand some of the key inaccuracies for yourself! These articles at The Guardian and Slate are good places to start, and visiting Bletchley Park is a truly wonderful day out! Turing did not break codes alone, and I particularly enjoyed learning about how many women had contributed so significantly to the allied war effort from that secret location.\nA trip to Bletchley Park is really worth it if you want to learn more about the intelligence work done by the thousands of workers during World War II. Taken March 2017  Around 200 people joined us in the Crick auditorium to watch the film, and at the end Aengus Stewart - head of Bioinformatics at the Crick, James Briscoe - a Group Leader of the Developmental Dynamics Laboratory and member of the Crick’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) committee, and I discussed a couple of key themes from the film.\n From left to right: Kath, James, Aengus and Kirstie discussing the Imitation Game and the importance of diversity and collaboration in science.  We talked about the importance of diversity in science. Ensuring that everyone can come to work and not have to hide who they are is not only the moral thing to do, but also collaborations are more effective and powerful if they take different view points and experiences into account.\nWe discussed bias in machine learning and artificial intelligence and the importance of representation in who builds the tools we use to affect the lives of millions of people every day.\nI talked about what Data Science is. (Spoiler alert, no one really knows, but here\u0026rsquo;s the wikipedia page to help you get started!) For me it is the emergence of a new field that comes from the interactions of currently existing areas of research. A set of questions that can only be answered when people with different skill sets come together.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very proud that the Alan Turing Institute celebrates his contributions to so many fields, and I was delighted to answer amazing questions from the audience members at The Crick last week. Huge thank yous go to Kath Nightingale for facilitating our discussion and Rosie Waldron for organising the event.\n","href":"/blog/2018-01-17-imitation-game-at-the-crick/","title":"Imitation Game at The Crick"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been off the grid over new year in a beautiful hut in Northumbria.

He studies longitudinal models of brain and behaviour across the lifespan. He is singularly capable in everything he sets his mind to, and funny and kind at the same time! Rogier and his wife - Dr Anne-Laura van Harmelen (a Royal Society fellow with a phenomenal £500,000 MQ grant) - used to take such great care of me when I was very unhappy in my first few years in Cambridge.\nThe picture below is of Rogier celebrating his son Flynn\u0026rsquo;s birthday at London Zoo last year.

This recognition is well deserved and I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly proud.\nUntil January 2017, Ian was the chief investigator of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network, a £5 million strategic award to the University of Cambridge and University College London from the Wellcome Trust. One of the goals of NSPN was to create a huge cohort of typically developing adolescents in order to better understand the emergence of mental health disorders. Some of that money paid for me to work as a postdoc within the consortium for 3 years.\nProf Goodyer is both a clinician - until his retirement in 2017 he was still seeing and treating young people with mental health disorders - and a scientist. You can read all about Ian\u0026rsquo;s contribution to our understanding of childhood and teenage mental health disorders in this great interview from 2015. But I want to finish this little blog post with a personal story:\nIan is literally the only faculty member in Cambridge who has ever asked me how I am, how my personal life is going and what he can do to help. It seems so small, but it will always mean so much to me to have someone ask after my own mental health as I studied major depressive disorder! Ian found me a desk when I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anywhere to sit, he supported me through my five years in Cambridge, and made me feel a valued member of the team.\nThe care he brings with him to the clinic and to the lab make this OBE incredibly well deserved on their own. The fact that he\u0026rsquo;s also spent his whole career advocating for a better understanding of why so many young people suffer in our country is just the icing on the cake.

I also applied successfully to the recently concluded 4th Mozilla Open Leadership Training cohort. With the application deadline for the next round of both approaching I thought I should share my experiences.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure when I sent my application in what open leadership training meant. Months later, I can now try to explain. Developing a project openly is partly a social endeavour. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t done it before (and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t), handling contributions and questions from strangers on the internet is weird and building a community to support your project is hard. The Open Leadership Training is a source of education and support in all issues open-leadership related.\n Shout out to the demo calls which I found a little nervewracking but are a great way to seek help from a wide audience  The Open Leadership\u0026rsquo;s medium is weekly videocalls, alternating between the cohort call (~30 people) and 1:1 calls with your assigned mentor. The cohort calls are usually low pressure and they focus on skills, practical advice and encouragement. For the nervous, I want to highlight that I never felt like me or my project were on trial.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t speak for anyone else\u0026rsquo;s 1:1 calls but in mine I would catch up with my mentor Tim Head, describe whatever problems I\u0026rsquo;d been having, mention my successes and he would offer relevant advice. Pretty good 👍, thank you Tim!\n You can apply to be part of the fifth Open Leadership Training cohort before 11:59EDT on 15th December 2017.\n Mozilla Mini Grant  When I need support now I just look deeply into my green Travis build status badge  I don\u0026rsquo;t need to propound the value of money to anyone, but refactoring Brain Networks in Python is a project I couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford to work on in this way otherwise. If you have an open scientific project that deserves your attention but you can\u0026rsquo;t buy the time, the Mozilla Science Lab mini grant might be your champion.\nIf it is useful, check out the application that Kirstie Whitaker and I wrote for Brain Networks in Python. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a huge amount of money, but for me it was so valuable to have two months of protected time to work on something I wanted to make more reusable. As Kirstie says, we want to make the code \u0026ldquo;useful for people who aren\u0026rsquo;t called Kirstie\u0026rdquo; 😂.\nOne of the goals of the mini grant was to add in tests to the code. I\u0026rsquo;m so proud of the green Travis build status badge that appears on the Brain Networks in Python GitHub page now.

Our mission is to make great leaps in data science research in order to change the world for the better. Five founding universities – Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, UCL and Warwick – along with the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council created The Alan Turing Institute in 2015. Our researchers collaborate across disciplines to generate impact, both through theoretical development and application to real-world problems. We are fuelled by the desire to innovate and add value.\nCross-disciplinary collaborations are hard. Implicit knowledge and scientific output standards vary dramatically between computer science, mathematics, engineering, economics, psychology and social science. Projects funded by fellowships such as the rOpenSci program can fill these gaps. Community management is currently undervalued and difficult to fund. The reproducible research liaison officer funded by this fellowship (see budget for details) will allow me to continue to build momentum towards an academic reward system that values reproducible research.\nMy colleagues in the research software engineering team and I seek to position The Alan Turing Institute as a world leader for reproducible research by embedding a culture of “reproducible by default” at the institute and providing training and tools to make reproducible research “too easy not to do”.\nReproducibility ensures that the wider academic, industry and governmental communities we operate in can easily validate, replicate and build on the work we produce. This will help us extend the Turing\u0026rsquo;s impact beyond the immediate outputs of the institute itself, providing a “force multiplier” effect on the progress of Data Science in the UK and beyond. The policy officer of The Alan Turing Institute, Helena Quinn, will make sure that our outputs are jargon free and fit for use by civil servants and national funding agencies.\nWe want the research outputs of the Turing to be seen as coming with a \u0026ldquo;quality seal of approval\u0026rdquo;. We want to lead by example to demonstrate how institutions can ensure that their work is reliable and trustworthy. We will build the Turing Reproducibility Champions program to raise the profile of excellent reproducible and reusable research.\nThe benefit to the global community will be highly curated, openly licensed (for remixing and reuse) documentation to support universities and research funders adopt, implement and enforce reproducible research policies. The Alan Turing Institute is ideally placed to spread the impact of our reproducible research programme to the wider community, with Knowledge Quarter partners including the British Library, The Wellcome Trust, UCL, The Francis Crick Institute and Figshare. The reproducible research liaison officer will organise open events for the wider community to share our learning and promote the resources developed by this program.\nKey focus: Accessible Data We will ensure that Turing researchers who have spent a long time collecting and curating datasets are able to make them available to others as easily as possible. We will build and provide clear guidance on ethical constraints and best practises regarding persistent data archiving. We will make it easy for data curators to receive citations for their hard work, for example by assigning digital online identifiers, or by publishing data description papers. We will work with the Turing communications team to ensure that the public datasets are promoted widely to members of the global data science community.\nWe will harness the expertise of members of the Turing working on encrypted data analyses to translate their work into guidance for data scientists publishing on sensitive or identifiable data. Not all data can be shared openly and it is imperative that our documentation provides options for all cases while also being clear, standardised and easy to follow. We will encourage the adoption of data management plans for all projects funded by the Turing. If they are created and followed from the beginning of the project, data management plans not only ensure that the database is an excellent resource for future research, they also ensure that the research team are more efficient in their analysis process.\nKey focus: Open Source Code To reproduce published findings, it is necessary to have the exact steps the researchers undertook in generating their results. We will support all members of the Alan Turing Institute in sharing the code they write with readers of their published results. As a minimum, we would like to ensure that publications from the Turing can be verified by any independent researcher.\nBeyond reproducible research, sharing analysis code allows members of the Turing and the wider community to \u0026ldquo;stand on the shoulders of giants\u0026rdquo; and benefit from the expertise of others. We will ensure that Turing members are working efficiently through two key avenues. Firstly, as with accessible data, we will help to provide documentation and dissemination channels to clearly communicate what effort has been undertaken to date.\nWe will also support members of the Turing by harnessing the power and expertise of the research software engineering team. They will work with researchers to develop code to a higher standard than is currently required of academic researchers. Members of the Turing and the data science community at large will benefit from reliable, documented, tested, version controlled analysis code. Funding for this aspect of the project has already been acquired through the Alan Turing Institute seed funding programme (see budget below for details).\nKey focus: Community building and skills training By design, the Turing comprises researchers of diverse backgrounds and expertise. Two often cited reasons for not ensuring that research is reproducible are 1) the lack of training provided in the software or protocols required for others to verify the work and 2) having “no time” to acquire the skills and knowledge.\nWe will provide getting-started resources and trainings for version control with git and GitHub, code testing, intro to coding in Python, R and Unix, along with \u0026ldquo;demystify\u0026rdquo; sessions around software engineering. The rOpenSci funded reproducible liaison officer will organise weekly office hours to provide in-person support along with regular newsletters to disseminate external resources. She will be responsible for facilitating communication between the Turing researchers, graduate students, business team and research software engineers, and to inspire community members to take the next step in ensuring that their work is reproducible (through the Turing Reproducibility Champions program, described below). We will continue to share our experiences with the Mozilla Open Science community, and we look forward to contributing to the rOpenSci community.\nProject plan Requirement Gathering The most important step in our plan is to see what already exists, what needs to be curated and if there are already tools that would do the job. We will focus on collecting information around:\n What tools already exist? What are researchers in the Turing using? What resources would best serve Turing researchers? Can we contribute to existing projects to make them even better? Do we need to create any new software?  Turing Reproducibility Champions The Turing reproducibility champions program will highlight 4-5 examples of research currently being conducted at the Turing. Specifically, we will ask researchers who are already working reproducibly to work with us to develop case studies. For example, the work that Tomas Petricek and May Yong recently showcased on Accounting for Democracy*. We will work with project leaders to ensure others (both within the Turing and externally) are able to access the research code and data, and work with the Turing communications team to promote these examples widely. The reproducibility champions will inspire their colleagues to adopt more reproducible practises and will allow us to refine a protocol for best supporting researchers as they publish their work.\n* This app is no longer online. Resource page updated in July 2019.\nBudget Requested fellowship funds:\n Reproducible research liaison officer: £20,000 ($25,000 USD) salary, £8,000 ($10,000 USD) onboarding costs. Total: £28,000 ($36,000 USD).  We will recruit and hire for either 6 months full time, or 12 months part time, a reproducible research liaison officer. She is likely to have a doctoral degree in a computational field to ensure that she is able to easily communicate with Turing researchers about their needs and current working practices. It is necessary that she has very strong communication skills and will be responsible for supporting the documentation of data and software, along with writing lay summaries to promote reproducible research from Turing members. The reproducible research liaison officer will work entirely openly from the start and seek to build connections between the Turing and others working towards a similar goal. She will undertake the requirement gathering exercises and manage the Turing Reproducibility Champions program, and will report to rOpenSci fellowship lead investigator Dr Kirstie Whitaker.\nFunds already acquired:\n Research software engineering time: 2 days per week for 12 months, £36,400 ($47,000). •\tLead investigator (Dr Kirstie Whitaker) salary through 3 year research fellowship to Turing Institute from EPSRC grant (EP/N510129).

(100 words)\nThe brain made up of many regions that communicate millions of messages every second. Traditional neuroimaging analyses have considered each region separately and therefore failed to capture many aspects of brain structure and function. Graph theory allows us to analyse human brain images as a network (Bullmore \u0026amp; Sporns, 2009). The most popular toolbox to do brain network analyses is written in Matlab (Brain Connectivity Toolbox; https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet) which requires an expensive (and therefore inaccessible) license. We want to provide free and openly available software to allow all neuroscience researchers to conduct reproducible and biologically meaningful investigations of the human brain.\nList key project activities (what you will do), outputs (what will be produced through your activities) and outcomes (impact of your project on your beneficiaries during the grant period). (1000 words)\nThe three goals of this mini-grant proposal are to 1) unlock the specialised knowledge required to conduct graph theoretic analyses on brain imaging data by providing clear documentation, 2) make an existing code base more modular and therefore flexible enough to be used for a wider range of applications, and 3) to promote a free and open source community driven project that facilitates the highest level of scientific research. The proposed activities, outputs and outcomes are explained in detail below.\nActivities\nThe Brain Networks in Python code was implemented in the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network publication \u0026ldquo;Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome\u0026rdquo; published in PNAS in 2016 (Whitaker*, Vertes* et al, 2016). The code conducts structural covariance network analyses on cortical thickness measurements from two independent cohorts and creates all figures and results tables for the published manuscript. The code and data to support the manuscript can be found at https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016.\nAs currently written, the Brain Networks in Python code is monolithic. It is very difficult to repurpose for new analyses or for different datasets. The first goal of this project will be to refactor the code into modules. Specifically, I will break down the conceptual steps for a network analysis and allow the user to re-combine them as they see fit. For example, one user may want to use the code only for the graph theory measures while another may use the visualisation module alone. It will be possible to link the modules together to complete an entire neuroimaging analysis from start to finish, but this workflow will not be necessary. Modularising the software will permit a more diverse user base and a much more interoperable set of code.\nThe second best time to add in tests for software is when refactoring. (The optimum time would have been when the code was written in the first place). As part of this 2 month project we will add in high level and unit tests for the network analysis code. Testing will give users confidence in our code and allow us to implement continuous integration. We are already developing in a version controlled enviroment on GitHub, but as the project develops, we will always be able to verify the accuracy of the modules.\nWe will also add new functionality to the code. There is currently no way (in this codebase) to investigate the difference in brain networks between two groups. For example, a key question in the field of biological psychiatry is whether the brains of people who have a diagnosis of depression are differently connected to the brains of healthy control participants. We will add a module that permutes the original data and builds up a null distribution so that differences between the two real groups, for example people with a diagnosis of depression and healthy controls, can be statistically tested.\nAlong with integrated tests, documentation will allow the Brain Networks in Python code to be used by many people. We will provide example data and clear tutorials to make it easy for users to install and get up and running with the code. These tutorials will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks that can be either downloaded and run locally or run in a MyBinder (http://mybinder.org) instance online. An example Jupyter notebook that is currently in development can be found at https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython/blob/master/Example_JupyterNotebook.ipynb.\nFinally, we will release our code as a Python package that can be easily installed via pip (https://packaging.python.org) or conda (https://conda.io). We will ensure that all released versions of our code have digital object identifiers from Zenodo (https://zenodo.org).\nOutputs\n MIT licensed, documented and tested code that is easy to use and re-use. Modular code that can be repurposed for individual use cases. An easy to install python package that can be cited in future publications. Version controlled code that permits rigorous reproducible neuroscience. An open and inclusive community dedicated to supporting new and veteran users and contributors.  Once a community grows around the project we hope to inspire additional integrations. For example collaborating with Mozilla Global Sprint project Cytoscape js (http://js.cytoscape.org) to provide interactive visualisations of the networks. We could also harness the power of Docker containers promoted by BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) Apps (http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io) to make it even easier for analyses to be reproducible and accessible. The code currently provides very standard graph theoretic measures, but we would hope to integrate novel computations such as the network versatility (Shinn et al, 2017; https://github.com/mwshinn/versatility).\nOutcomes\nThe Brain Networks in Python project will make it easier to conduct reproducible analyses of neuroimaging data. We will focus on smoother onboarding for new users (for example graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) to conduct network analyses. We will ensure that early career researchers from around the world can conduct the most rigorous and state of the art analyses of the human brain.\nThe outcomes of this project during the grant period will be to increase the number of researchers who have the confidence to use and contribute to free and open source software. By supporting our community of early career researchers we will build towards a critical mass of scientists who require open, reproducible and accessible research as a standard for the future of research.\nProvide key indicators you plan to use to measure project outcomes and source of data. (500 words)\n Number of contributors. We will track the number of commits in any branch of the project along with any comments on issues or pull request reviews as contributions using the Let All Build a Hatrack tool (https://labhr.github.io). We will acknowledge these contributors publicly within the GitHub project repository using Kent Dodd\u0026rsquo;s All Contributors emoji key (https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors). Package downloads. We will track the number of downloads of our Python package using the http://pypi-ranking.info website. Scientific citations of the code. We will track the Zenodo DOI for each version of the code to see how often the Brain Networks in Python code is used in academic publications. There are three projects that Kirstie Whitaker is already involved in that will cite the code on submission for publication by the end of 2017.  Explain who will benefit from the project. (100 words)\nEarly career researchers who are new to network neuroscience will benefit from this project and will find friendly support for their endeavors from the development team.\nComplex network analysts will benefit from the example data and option of their models being integrated into the project to facilitate wider adoption in the neuroimaging community.\nReproducible and version controlled software means that the provenance of an analysis can be recorded. It also ensures efficient knowledge transfer and therefore this project benefits senior scientists as expertise will not leave their group when one member advances to a new position.\nList any risks or challenges that may affect the overall success of your project and now how Mozilla and/or others can help you to overcome these challenges. (250 words)\nAlthough the code has been used very successfully by Kirstie Whitaker in previous publications, it is difficult to understand for external collaborators. I have been working hard to implement the code but it has been necessary to walk over to Kirstie\u0026rsquo;s desk and ask her to explain (for example) naming structures and project organisation.\nIt is easy to see how this situation developed. The person who originally wrote the code understands it so well that she has expert blindness to the challenges that fresh eyes may experience. It is imperative that we have user input from the beginning. The Mozilla Science Lab network will provide excellent opportunities to report on project development and receive feedback from the community.\nOne of the greatest challenges for the project is that of finding time to build documentation, add in a test suite and refactor the code to be more modular and therefore more widely applicable. This mini-grant will be particularly valuable in levelling up the code base to make it easy to use for international standard publications in the field of network neuroscience.\nIs this a new project or continuation? If new, please describe your qualifications to initiate the activity. If continued, please describe your accomplishments to date. Feel free to include links to articles and documents online that highlight your recent work. (1000 words)\nThe project is a continuation of the work that Dr Kirstie Whitaker published in 2016 (Whitaker*, Vertes* et al, 2016). The code is openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016). For this work, Dr Whitaker and her collaborator Petra Vertes were named as 2016 Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine.\nDr Whitaker\u0026rsquo;s CV is available at our lab GitHub repository: https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/blob/master/weekly-updates/Kirstie-Whitaker/Whitaker_CV.pdf\nI am a research assistant in the Whitaker Lab at the Alan Turing Institute. I have a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge which included specialised training in graph theory and topological analysis.\nI have advanced coding skills in Matlab and Python, including expertise in the matplotlib, networkx, numpy and pandas libraries that are used by the Brain Networks in Python project. I am a proficient git \u0026amp; GitHub user, and have experience writing academic documents in LaTeX.\nI am already working on the project described in this proposal and a list of my code contributions can be found at https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython/commits?author=Islast.\nMozilla works in the open. How will you document and share your project progress with the community. (250 words)\nThe Brain Networks in Python project is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython.\nWe follow the Mozilla open leadership training best practice principles (https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series). The Brain Networks in Python project has a README file, a code of conduct and a guide for contributors.\nWithin the Whitaker Lab we work as openly as possible. All the weekly meetings I have with Dr Whitaker are available (https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/tree/master/weekly-updates/alumni/Isla-Staden/Weekly-Meetings.md). We are dedicated to sharing work in progress so that others can provide help and feedback. In my first week as a member of the Whitaker Lab I contributed to the Whitaker Lab blog (https://whitakerlab.github.io/blog/Hello-Earthling) and I am greatly looking forward to the opportunity to engage further with the brain networks community through social media and further blog posts.\nHow will you continue work on this project beyond the funding period? (250 words)\nDr Whitaker will continue to lead the Brain Networks in Python project during her five year fellowship at the Turing Institute. I hope to find funding to continue my contributions beyond the end of the grant period possibly through the Alan Turing Institute\u0026rsquo;s seed funding program. A requirement for seed funding is that a product or publication can be completed in six months. The Mozilla mini-grant would give me time to build community around the Brain Networks in Python software and therefore build a successful application to the internal Turing funding body.\nImportantly however, I may not be needed to continue on the project. If our two month summer program of refactoring, modularisation, testing, documentation and community building goes to plan we will have a powerful open source community that can continue to develop without my input. I hope to remain involved in the project, but I also hope that I am not necessary. A key deliverable of this mini-grant would be a Brain Networks in Python package that can sustain itself in a stable form.\nUpload documents Please upload an itemized project budget using the template linked below.\nhttp://bit.ly/2riERqd\nCommunications How did you hear about the mini-grant opportunity?\n Twitter Blog Friend Other  Do you want to be added to our Mozilla Science Lab mailing list?\n Yes Not at this time  ","href":"/resources/2017-08-05-mozilla-science-mini-grant-june2017/","title":"Mozilla Mini Grant application 2017"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/network-neuroscience/","title":"network-neuroscience"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/sobp/","title":"sobp"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m very excited to present our work on structural brain development during adolescence at the Society of Biological Psychiatry 2017 annual meeting in San Diego.\nMy talk is part of a symposium on Network Architectures of the Healthy Brain as Constraints for the Spatiotemporal Patterning of Disease.

Please use your own words to describe your perspective and experience.\nI am a member of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN), a collaboration of around 60 researchers at the University of Cambridge and University College London. Funded by a £5 million Wellcome Trust Strategic Award in 2012, we have collected neuroimaging data from more than 350 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 24 at multiple time points. My recent work on the mechanisms of adolescent brain development of particularly well connected brain regions (network \u0026ldquo;hubs\u0026rdquo;) integrated MRI measures of cortical thickness and myelination with human gene expression data openly released by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.\nAll our results replicated in two independent cohorts and the data and code to reproduce our findings is openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016). Our work would not have been possible without the exceptional Allen Brain Atlas and I look forward to supporting the innovations that will come when others build on the data we collected.\nNSPN is made up of talented statisticians, clinicians, physicists, psychologists and epidemiologists, and every member is passionate about producing ground-breaking interdisciplinary research. I coordinate and lead regular meetings in order to facilitate collaboration and the exchange of new analysis hypotheses, techniques and interpretations. By working openly together we are all better equipped to translate basic science to clinical applications and thus make a difference in the millions of lives affected by adolescent mental health disorders.\nThe biggest goal of OpenCon is to catalyze action. What ideas do you have for advancing Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data, and how would you use your experience at OpenCon to have an impact? Maximum 1600 characters (~250 words).\nI am most motivated to build momentum around recent efforts to enhance the reproducibility and replicability in science. Publication bias and researcher degrees of freedom limit the translation of neuroimaging studies to the clinic and we are wasting millions of dollars each year on closed basic research and unpublished clinical trials. With the advent of open data requirements, we are able to investigate the invaluable, and often unasked, question: Which neuroimaging findings are generalisable?\nGeneralisable results are those which are robust to similar but not identical analysis techniques, and which hold across different data sets. The first steps towards this answer is to ensure that all publications are reproducible (what they say they did is what they did) and to support the publication of a priori replication studies that use the same analysis pipeline on an independent cohort.\nI am confident that the ideas generated when members of the OpenCon community come together will transform my dream of knowing which results can be relied upon when developing treatments for mental health disorders, into a reality. I am excited to share my field’s innovations that overcome some of the challenges regarding data storage and methodological plurality and I look forward to building educational tools to prevent researchers from “re-inventing the wheel”. I hope to learn about faster, non-traditional publishing methods, including living manuscripts and ways in which we can clean up the published literature to more prominently promote and reward open, reproducible research.\nFor the events you checked, please explain how you participated and/or how you plan to participate. Maximum 600 characters (~100 words).\nLast year I co-organised the first OpenCon Cambridge meeting. Run as a satellite event of OpenCon in November 2015 we sought to build connections between researchers, students, librarians, policy makers, government data analysts and citizen scientists. As a result of our vibrant half-day event we now hold regular lunch meetings and maintain an active mailing list: the introductions and discussions continue to thrive. We have begun planning our OpenCon Cambridge 2016 event and will promote the University’s Open Access Week, Open Data Day and Open Education Day events widely to our network.\n","href":"/resources/2017-05-13-opencon-application-2016/","title":"OpenCon application 2016"},{"content":"As my first exercise at the Whitaker Lab, Kirstie, immediately detecting my social frailty, has asked me to introduce myself to some strangers at the Alan Turing Institute and ask them about their work.\nHieu Hoang Hieu Hoang looks after Moses a major open source implementation of machine translation. Machine translation means translating natural languages (where natural languages are English, Yoruba, Cantonese etc) into one another via machine, a la Google Translate. Machine translation starts by finding large corpora of texts that already exist in multiple languages to learn from. This training data may come from sources as diverse as EU law, UN documents, Linux manuals and film subtitles. It can be hard to find corpora comparing obscure languages to each other directly, so in these cases a language might be translated into English and retranslated into the target language, which apparently doesn\u0026rsquo;t go as badly as you think. Asked what might change in his field, Hieu said that neural networks are gathering momentum as a tool for finding the best translations, now that there is more data and better hardware to support them.\nDarren Grey When I described my assignment (talking to people) to Darren he asked me if I know what a test to distinguish a machine from a human via conversation is called. Touché Darren.\nDarren manages the data-centric engineering programme at the Alan Turing Institute. The goal is to apply the cutting edge capabilities of data science to engineering. Darren notes that huge structures like cities, buildings and transport networks create masses of data. That data can be used to improve these systems, making them more safe, reliable and efficient. As he points out, autonomous transport is an area where we are already seeing this change. A large part of his job is connecting people from different disciplines. He says that as a new organization, the Alan Turing Institute attracts a lot of novel challenges, and he enjoys that.\nBarbara McGillivray Understanding the changes in language throughout history is a problem that has traditionally been tackled qualitatively, and there is good reason for that. Meaning is shaped by the knowledge that the reader possesses of the world around us (among other things), so it is a great challenge for the computer which must make sense of historical data. Taking advantage of the expertise of traditional scholars and advances in data science Barbara intends to answer these questions quantitatively and on a much larger scale. A program can follow a word through scores of historical texts trying to identify the changes in context that indicate a change in meaning. Her work is concerned with both the remote and recent past.\nA huge thank you to Hieu, Darren and Barbara for chatting to me 🎉✨\n","href":"/blog/2017-05-12-hello-earthling/","title":"Hello Earthlings"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/turing-institute/","title":"turing-institute"},{"content":"My Mozilla Fellowship journey I wrote a blog post for the Mozilla Science Lab to encourage everyone to apply for the 2017 Mozilla fellows for science cohort.\nYou can check out the whole post at the Mozilla Science Lab blog but here are a couple of key links.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve put my applications online in the resources section of this website if you want to see what I wrote:\n My unsuccessful 2015 application My successful 2016 application  Here\u0026rsquo;s where you can find out more information and apply!\n tl;dr: Apply today.

We only had one evening but we tried to fit as much of what we knew about working open and collaborating using git and GitHub as possible.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how we described it at our eventbrite invitation:\n The Working Open Workshop (or WOW) is a set of trainings created by Mozilla Science Lab to help up-and-coming leaders of open science and open research projects make the most effective open projects possible, and build active communities of contributors around them. For this micro event, we will focus on teaching how you can use Git/GitHub for collaborative work and share some best practices tips on how to build a community around your project!\n We held the event in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences of Queen Mary University of London. Thank you for hosting us QMUL! ✨ ✨\nFriendly GitHub Intro We based our evening around the Friendly GitHub Intro that Joey Lee originally developed in 2016.\nWe covered two exercises: building your first repository, and submitting and merging your first pull request. The second in particular was great fun because everyone had to pair up and be both the owner of the repository, and therefore the gatekeeper who chose whether or not to merge the request, and the contributor who wanted to suggest a new addition.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t push your pull request In this very quick introduction to working open we talked about the importance of the README welcome mat, a CODE_OF_CONDUCT, the LICENSE so others know how they can use your work, and the CONTRIBUTING file that gives guidelines to the folk who are sharing their work with you.\nI want to recommend this blog post \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t push your pull requests\u0026rdquo; to anyone who is thinking about submitting some work to be merged into an open source project.\nBuilding up communities around your projects is one of the most challenging and rewarding parts of building an open source project.

(50 words)\nI aim to integrate multiple neuroimaging techniques of brain development during childhood and adolescence to predict individual differences in susceptibility to mental health problems and response to interventions. I use graph theory to investigate changes in MRI measures of brain structure and function, and the biological mechanisms underlying brain networks.\nDescribe to us your current research team (50 words)\nThe Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network is a collaboration between the University of Cambridge and University College London, funded by a £5 million Wellcome Trust Strategy Award. The team comprises 5 principal investigators, 2 project managers, 10 postdoctoral fellows, 5 graduate students, and 12 administrative staff situated across 7 geographic locations.\nCover letter (250 words)\nDuring my PhD I was mentored and inspired by exceptional scientists and computer programmers. In my 3 years at the University of Cambridge, I have picked up their baton and helped collaborators, researchers in my department, and over 50 members of the Cambridge Women in Technology meetup group learn to code. I am incensed when I witness (particularly) women being instructed to rely on others for their mathematical, computation or statistical analyses and am dedicated to empowering my peers to produce clinically relevant, reproducible and rigorous results through continued education and interdisciplinary collaboration.\nAs a physicist I was taught, and have taught others, to always provide proof of my logical inductions and to show my working. I follow these principles today by ensuring my neuroimaging analyses can be independently reproduced: pre-processing is scripted, statistical calculations are performed in R or Python and figures are created from the original data using the open source packages in Python. My code is commented and publicly available at www.GitHub.com/KirstieJane.\nThe field of neuroimaging has experienced a crisis of false positives and misleading statistical thresholding, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Mozilla Science Lab, and others, have inspired a critical mass of researchers who understand the benefits of meta-analyses, publishing null-results, pre-registration, sharing data and collaborative working. I relish this opportunity to extend and expand all of our efforts as a champion for open science and ambassador for the open web. Thank you for your consideration.\nYours sincerely, Kirstie Whitaker\nDescribe to us how open science advances your research (100 words)\nPsychiatric disorders are responsible for 184 million disability-adjusted life years worldwide (Whiteford et al, 2013) and there is strong evidence that environmental and genetic effects affect the structure and function of the developing brain, which in turn leads to individual differences in each person’s susceptibility to mental health disorders. However, neuroimaging studies are often underpowered and are always expensive and statistically noisy. When these data sets are published alongside their findings everyone benefits: researchers investigating similar questions may validate their findings in an independent cohort, computational modellers may test new methods, and analytic errors can be caught and corrected.\nWhat work are you currently involved in that\u0026rsquo;s relevant to being an open science leader? Are you leading any projects related to open science? (100 words)\nNSPN is made up of talented statisticians, clinicians, physicists, psychologists and epidemiologists, and every member is passionate about producing ground-breaking interdisciplinary research. I have taken responsibility for designing and implementing MRI processing and quality assurance pipelines, and for providing documentation and processed values to other members of the team. I am passionate about empowering my colleagues and explaining code in my GitHub repositories rather than encouraging a “black box” analysis strategy. I coordinate and lead regular meetings for all early career researchers within the network in order to facilitate collaboration and the exchange of new analysis hypotheses, techniques and interpretations.\nHow would this fellowship accelerate your work? (50 words)\nThis fellowship would provide me with the networking and technical support required to integrate the different data types collected within NSPN and to share them online while maintaining strict levels of participant anonymity. I will be faster and more efficient in my analyses, as will our internal and external collaborators.\nWhat do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project? (100 words)\nThe University of Cambridge has been a leader in the natural sciences since its foundation in 1209 and remains committed to its position as an international role model for academic research. Financial and educational resources to facilitate data sharing are available (cf. www.data.cam.ac.uk) but I will develop personalised curricula to ensure their visibility, uptake and understanding. In sharing data from the multi-disciplinary Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network I will bring external collaborations to the university, increase the impact of our work on the development of mental health disorders, and serve as a flagship example of best practise in open science.\nWhat do you think needs to change most immediately in the system? (50 words)\nRaw data, all analysis code and the instructions to replicate all figures need to be made available to reviewers with all submitted journal articles. It is simply not enough to say what one did or found, the data and code must be available for independent verification.\nWhat project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web? (50 words)\nI am most inspired by the Neurosynth project (www.neurosynth.org): an online platform for large-scale meta-analyses of functional MRI data through text mining published articles. You can explore associations between regional brain activations and each of over 3000 terms, or decode your own results in real time by reversing the process.\nWhy is the open web important to you? (100 words)\nThe open web is the great equaliser. It doesn’t matter where you come from, your gender, sexual orientation or race: the open web allows you to meet peers, mentors, role models and friends. Academia is competitive and, sometimes, dangerously isolating. The mental health challenges for highly educated “trainees” is often not appreciated by those in power and the “crushing self-doubt” of the imposter complex pervades our halls. The open web allows science to advance by sharing our deeper understandings (rather than only the novel or unexpected results) and by supporting the real human beings who undertake those analyses every day.\n","href":"/resources/2017-04-28-mozilla-science-fellowship-application-2015/","title":"Mozilla Fellows for Science Application 2015"},{"content":"On this page you can find the answers from my (successful!) application to become a Mozilla Fellow for Science in 2016.\nThe application was submitted on Jul 15th at 11:33pm (swoosh, just before the deadline).\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License which means you can distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon these answers as long as you credit me for the original creation.\nApplication Essays What research fields are you in?

(100 words)\nI lead the Brains For Publication project that provides command line and browser based tools to reproducibly create beautiful and informative figures for neuroimaging publications (https://github.com/KirstieJane/BrainsForPublication). It is particularly aimed at people with beginner level coding skills and has a high focus on documentation and usability. I lead the development of the STEMM Role Models database that promotes members of under-represented groups in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels).

(100 words)\nWe must incentivise the measurement of the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings. We should preregister our analyses, publish null results and ensure that researchers are rewarded for rigour rather than novelty. The scientific method is defined by the constant testing, updating and integration of previously acquired knowledge and it is essential we return to that philosophy. At a minimum, raw data, analysis code and instructions to recreate figures need to be made available to reviewers with all submitted journal articles. More extensively, we must better reward the people who build, develop and document tools to facilitate this process.\nWhat project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web?

I hope to capture in this page, the growth that I have already achieved in the last year through my membership of the MSL community, and to outline the strengths I will bring as a fellow in the coming months.\nThe timing of the Working Open Workshop (WOW) in Berlin, to which I was invited in February 2016, could not have been better. Before I flew from London I attended a mentoring day for finalists of the Rosalind Franklin Appathon: an international competition to build new mobile phone apps to empower women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine. My project idea, which went on to win the runners up prize, was designed to tackle the problem that women are less likely to be invited to speak at academic conferences and therefore are less able to promote their work or build new collaborations. In the STEMM Role Models database, any member of traditionally underrepresented groups can be nominated and vouched for as outstanding in their field. We seek to inspire the current and future generations of researchers and technology industry professional by making it easy for organisers to providing the most exciting and diverse speakers at their event.\nOn arrival at WOW I had an idea, but needed support to put it into action. By the end of the three-day workshop I had a github repository, a guide for contributors, a roadmap, an explanation of the project and even a lean canvas business plan. More importantly, I had the confidence and the support network to make the STEMM Role Models app a reality. As a member of the Open Leader’s Cohort I had fortnightly meetings with my mentors, Abby Cabanouc and Aurelia Moser. They supported the development of my first website, helped me promote my project to the Mozilla Science Lab network, and held my hand as I learned how to manage contributors from around the world who all had different skill sets and levels of expertise. I developed communication and leadership skills that I didn’t know I was missing, and I am so proud of the ongoing work of our development team.\nIn my “day job” I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN). My recent publication used graph theoretic models to describe the mechanisms of adolescent brain development of particularly well connected regions, the “hubs”, of the connectome. We integrated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of cortical thickness and myelination with human gene expression data openly released by the Allen Institute for Brain Science and replicated all our results in two independent cohorts. We shared the data and code to reproduce our findings on GitHub but over the next year I will take responsibility for further opening up the NSPN database and analysis code with the wider scientific community. Our analyses would not have been possible without the exceptional Allen Brain Atlas dataset and I look forward to supporting the as yet unknown innovations that will come when others build on the MRI scan data we collected.\nAs a Mozilla science fellow I will have access to the skills, innovation, and – most importantly – the protected time to ensure I am able to share the NSPN MRI data to the very highest standards of openness, accessibility and ethical integrity. I will hone my collaborative working skills and foster their development within the diverse team of talented statisticians, clinicians, physicists, psychologists and epidemiologists. Every member is passionate about producing ground-breaking interdisciplinary research and I am confident that we will build a symbiotic exchange of analysis hypotheses, techniques and interpretations with innovations in open source software development, open access publishing and diverse and inclusive scientific communication. By working together, we are all better equipped to translate basic science to clinical applications and thus make a difference in the millions of lives affected by adolescent mental health disorders.\nIf I were to sum up what I’ve learned as a Mozillian over the last year it would be that leadership is a web rather than a linear hierarchy. Everyone can be both mentor and mentee, provide support and be supported, and inspire and be inspired by every other member of their community. No one is perfect and everyone’s contributions are valuable. With a little empathy, a lot of encouragement, and by celebrating our differences, together, we can change the world.\nWith very best regards,\nKirstie Whitaker, PhD\n","href":"/resources/2017-04-28-mozilla-science-fellowship-application-2016/","title":"Mozilla Fellows for Science Application 2016"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/mozwow/","title":"MozWOW"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/trainings/","title":"trainings"},{"content":"","href":"/page/search/","title":""},{"content":"","href":"/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"}]
