She pushed <a href=https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/binderhub-deploy>a new feature</a> to the Azure button so that users can now choose between Docker Hub and Azure container registries, and began <a href=https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/binderhub-deploy-gke>developing a button for Google Cloud</a>.
She enabled HTTPS on Hub23 🚀, her bot made its first automated pull request 🤖, and she practiced her talk for RSE Con <a href="https://twitter.com/betatim/status/1170337404491915265?s=20">in front of the experts</a> 😱.</p><figure><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-09-12/binder-jupyterhub-team.jpg alt="Ten team members standing in front of a lake smiling at the camera"><figcaption>The Binder and JupyterHub teams in Oslo.

She also got accepted to give a talk at the <a href=https://www.springernature.com/gp/campaign/scidata-lightning-talks>Better Science through Better Data 2019</a> conference in November.</p><p><strong>Louise</strong> has been really unwell and would like to remind everyone that sometimes it&rsquo;s better (necessary!) to take <em>more than one day</em> off work.
Especially when it would stop you from getting <em>even more</em> ill 🤒
Feel better soon Louise! 🤗</p><p><strong>Christina</strong> has finished editing her on children&rsquo;s social care and is now preparing a conference presentation on a totally different topic!!
Good luck! 💪</p><p><strong>Patricia</strong> is making good progress on her good habit forming in Edinburgh by <a href=https://twitter.com/PHerterich/status/1171705626310918146>having fruit easily accessible</a> - supported by lovely colleagues 🙌</p><p><strong>Yo</strong> is climbing sand dunes in Israel and wandering through ancient (3000 to 4000 years old) underground hand-carved water channels under Jerusalem.</p><p><strong>Yini</strong> is looking forward to attending the <a href=http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/events/ABC2019/pages/abc-programme.html>Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium</a>.
She knows quite a bit about mental health (on Friday afternoon) but the section on robotics is going to be very new!
She&rsquo;s slightly nervous but mostly excited.</p><p><strong>Alex</strong> really enjoyed the reinforcement learning talks at <a href=http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/events/ABC2019/pages/abc-programme.html>#ABC2019</a>.</p><p><strong>Kirstie</strong> has been zooming around the country.
She gave a talk on <em>The Turing Way</em> in Edinburgh for the MQ Data Science Meeting (doi <a href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3402510>10.5281/zenodo.3402510</a>) and watched some incredible keynote talks from PyCon and SciPy on the train <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1170250790579187712?s=20">from</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1170250790579187712?s=20">to London</a>.
Today she ran the early career data blitz at the Cambridge Neuroscience Symposium.
She didn&rsquo;t have to use the buzzer on my phone once!
Everyone stayed within their 2 minutes.
She was so proud! 😍</p><p>The Data Blitz resources are <a href=https://github.com/WhitakerLab/DataBlitzResources>publicly available</a> if anyone wants to run something similar.</p><h2 id=questions-were-thinking-about>Questions we&rsquo;re thinking about</h2><p><strong>Georgia</strong> would love to hear some feedback on the <a href=https://github.com/GeorgiaHCA/OpenScienceGame>open science game</a> that her team at the eLife Innovation Sprint created.
We&rsquo;ve booked a room to play it together next week!</p><p><strong>Louise</strong> is pondering joining Twitter 🙀
The question is how much time it will soak up!
She&rsquo;s wondering if Twitter is a useful way to spend your time or does it become a source of procrastination too easily?</p><p>The lab had a few different pieces of advice, from a recommendation to turn off notifications if you want to concentrate, and to remember that it is a directed graph - you can join and listen and you don&rsquo;t have to tweet until you want to.</p><p>As to the time it takes, <strong>Patricia</strong> said:</p><blockquote><p>I might procrastinate on Twitter, but it connects me to so many inspiring people and is super helpful to rant if you feel frustrated that I feel that makes up for me sometimes wasting a bit of time there.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Christina</strong> is looking for researchers and/or speakers in the UK on <em>AI and environment</em>, <em>AI and global inequality or economic inequality</em>, <em>Law, ethics, and innovation or startups</em>, <em>LawTech and the future and limits of automating the law</em>, <em>AI tools and creativity</em>, <em>IP and AI</em>, <em>AI and trade</em>, <em>AI and Defense</em> or <em>AI and ethics and healthcare</em>.
If you do, please <a href=https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christina-hitrova>get in touch</a>!
And if you are knowledgeable about health tech then please join the OneHealthTech <a href=https://www.onehealthtech.com/speaker-corner>Speaker Corner</a> so folks can find you and learn from you!</p><p><strong>Patricia</strong> is wondering about the best ways to feel productive when you&rsquo;re the newest kid on the team and its hard to see how you&rsquo;re contributing when you&rsquo;re mostly reading documentation!
(Imposter syndrome is a pain in the butt 😒.)
Kirstie recomended taking a <a href=https://rubberduckdebugging.com>rubber duck debugging</a> to creating a fun onboarding schedule for the next person!
But mostly, hugs 💖</p><p><strong>Yo</strong>, <strong>Malvika</strong> and Berenice Batut want to know what open science/source/access/data/whateverelse thing do you think is absolutely essential for working openly?
Kirstie (on brand as usual) suggested that this could be a chapter in <em>The Turing Way</em> and answered that confidence is the most important thing.</p><blockquote><p>Its so unusual to show your work as you go along, but if you&rsquo;ve ever been on the other side you know how incredibly powerful and helpful it is!
So &ldquo;grasping the nettle&rdquo; and believing that it will be worth it even if it feels uncomfortable when people tell you to do things that you just haven&rsquo;t got around to doing yet is the most important thing (in my opinion!)</p></blockquote><p><strong>Yini</strong> is wondering about how to come up with a good title for her paper.
What suggestions does everyone have to come up with the best one?</p><p>Kirstie said that she&rsquo;s always had someone else make up titles for her papers, grants, everything really!
And so her main tip is to have a first attempt and then get lots of feedback on how to improve the title!
She also found some useful blog posts and articles:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.biosciencewriters.com/Writing-Strong-Titles-for-Research-Manuscripts.aspx>Writing Strong Titles for Research Manuscripts</a></li><li><a href="https://library.sacredheart.edu/c.php?g=29803&p=185911">Organizing Academic Research Papers: Choosing a Title</a></li><li>And even though this is about the abstract rather than the title it&rsquo;s always worth sharing: <a href=https://www.nature.com/documents/nature-summary-paragraph.pdf>How to construct a Nature summary paragraph</a></li></ul><p><strong>Ang</strong> wonders about how to learn more about <a href=http://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/cause-effect/>cause-effect pairs data</a>.
He found it a little strange to detect causal-effect in data with only two variables.
<strong>Alex</strong> pointed him at a few different (and overlapping) frameworks for causal analysis such as structural equation models, graphical models, and counterfactual analysis.
He recommended the book <a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Causality-Reasoning-Inference-Judea-Pearl/dp/0521773628>&ldquo;Causality: Models, Reasoning and Interference&rdquo;</a> by Judea Pearl.
(If you don&rsquo;t want to commit to the book you can read <a href=https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf>a nice overview</a> by the author.
He pointed out that bivariate cause-effect models are often used in time-series data (sometimes called &lsquo;Granger causality&rsquo;) and recommended a paper by Granger, Huangb and Yang (doi: <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/S1062-9769(00)00042-9>10.1016/S1062-9769(00)00042-9</a>, <a href=https://escholarship.org/content/qt9bk607p6/qt9bk607p6.pdf>open access version</a>) for a good discussion involving stock prices and exchange rates.</p><p><strong>Kirstie</strong> and <strong>Georgia</strong> are wondering where to send the position paper that outlines the goals of the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project.
If anyone has any ideas for a journal that would publish something like a combination of an opinion piece and a review article (saying why the work needs to be done) please let her know.</p><p><strong>Alex</strong> is looking for recommendations for content aggregators.</p><h2 id=anything-else>Anything else</h2><p>Whew!
Busy busy.
We don&rsquo;t have anything else to share this week.
Keep up the amazing work everyone <em>&ndash;Kirstie</em> ✨</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class="container sep-before"><div class=categories><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M22 19a2 2 0 01-2 2H4a2 2 0 01-2-2V5A2 2 0 014 3H9l2 3h9a2 2 0 012 2z"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Categories: </span><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>blog</a></div><div class=tags><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2H12l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Tags: </span><a class=tag href=/tags/lab-meeting/>lab-meeting</a></div></div></footer></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class="prev-entry sep-before"><a href=/blog/2019-09-05-lab-meeting/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
