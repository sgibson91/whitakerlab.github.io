They&rsquo;re discussing how to extend the project to include ethics, scoping and designing a data science project, communicating your results (outreach, visualisation, how to write a paper etc) and guides for effective and inclusive collaboration.
🙀🚀💫🙌</p><p><strong>Malvika</strong> and Kirstie will be co-working at <a href=https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/house/>MozFest House</a> on <strong>Thursday 24 October</strong> between 10am and 4pm.
It would be lovely to see as many lab members there as possible (at the regular lab meeting time, 3pm) for a general update on the <em>Turing Way</em> project.</p><p><strong>Kirstie</strong> was also excited to share that the <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/799690-open-as-in-book>Open as in Book</a> discussion this month is right at the end of the sprint - at the time she&rsquo;ll need it most - and on one of her absolute favourite books: <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29633913-emergent-strategy>Emergent Strategy</a> by <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1536532.Adrienne_Maree_Brown>adrienne maree brown</a>.
You can read more about it (without buying the book) at <a href=https://praxis.fortelabs.co/emergent-strategy-organizing-for-social-justice>https://praxis.fortelabs.co/emergent-strategy-organizing-for-social-justice</a>.
She shared the principles from the book:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Small is good, small is all (The large is a reflection of the small)</li><li>Change is constant (Be like water)</li><li>There is always enough time for the right work. There is a conversation in the room that only these people at this moment can have. Find it.</li><li>Never a failure, always a lesson</li><li>Trust the People (If you trust the people, they become trustworthy)</li><li>Move at the speed of trust</li><li>Focus on critical connections more than critical mass—build the resilience by building the relationships</li><li>Less prep, more presence</li><li>What you pay attention to grows</li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Konrad</strong> met this week with someone whose role at UCL is to facillitate the <a href=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/translational-research>translation of basic science to clinical practice</a>.
He found it eye-opening to think about all the parts of a translational project that are separate to any of the basic science: needing a project manager, business plan, considering intellectual property, additional funding, and managing clinical trials.</p><p><strong>Patricia</strong> One of the SSI Fellows currently runs a survey on remote collaboration - it would be great if lab members could <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_DwyAOkbmWw8T1Qug-e04qlb6lZh6VwYE4T_bGYd8XV3gcA/viewform>complete the form</a>.</p><p><strong>Georgia</strong> has been running and analysing focus groups with autistic people and developers.
She&rsquo;s found it really interesting to see how ideas are being sparked.
Its tough not to inadvertantly lead the conversation!</p><p><strong>Yini</strong> shared a book she was reading: &ldquo;Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason&rdquo;(<a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Madness-Civilization-M-Foucault/dp/067972110X>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Madness-Civilization-M-Foucault/dp/067972110X</a>) by French philospher <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault>Michel Foucault</a>.
The book changed a lot of people&rsquo;s perceptions of madness and also changed the prejudices about some specific groups.</p><p><strong>Ang</strong> shared a paper recently published in eLife: &ldquo;Science Forum: Ten common statistical mistakes to watch out for when writing or reviewing a manuscript&rdquo; (doi:<a href=https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48175>10.7554/eLife.48175</a>).</p><p><strong>Sarah</strong> was interviewed for her friend&rsquo;s blog about her decision to leave academia.
(&ldquo;Spoiler alert: best decision ever!")

Congratulations!! 🎉🎉🎉 from all the lab 🏆</p><p><strong>Elizabeth</strong> has been working on her JavaScript to try and help <a href=https://jupyterbook.org>Jupyter Book</a>&mldr; which has in in-practice meant working on her <a href=https://github.com/emdupre/bloom>website builder</a>.
She recommended <a href=https://vuejs.org/>Vue.js</a> if you haven&rsquo;t tried it yet 🌺</p><h2 id=questions-were-thinking-about>Questions we&rsquo;re thinking about</h2><p><strong>Kirstie</strong> wants to know your thoughts on what would motivate PhD students, PIs and business team members to contribute to <a href=https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way><em>The Turing Way</em></a>?
What would be the drivers for members of these groups?
What are the barriers?
<strong>Isla</strong> suggested that a barrier may be feeling un- or under-qualified and not wanting to bloat the material.
She could imagine potential contributors being nervous of making unnecessary contributions and taking up reviewers' time or adding redundancy.</p><p><strong>Konrad</strong> is wondering about business models that balance an open science approach <em>and</em> deliver a clinical tool.
<a href=https://meldproject.github.io>MELD</a> has been built on open code and data from the start and the team feel strongly that this should remain the case&mldr;. but building a usable clinical tool (rather than &ldquo;just&rdquo; demonstrating the prototype principle) is a massive undertaking requiring many people and significant funding.
Anyone know of any good examples?</p><p><strong>Patricia</strong> is in the mood to run another <strong>ScienceTogether</strong> workshop.
This was the event that she randomly attended in 2017 that got her into the SSI/RSE bubble: an unconference about <em>collaborative tools</em>.
(The site isn&rsquo;t online anymore, but you can checkout <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018063115/http://sciencetogether.online/>an archived version</a> from <a href=https://web.archive.org>https://web.archive.org/</a>, or <a href=https://software.ac.uk/blog/2017-04-20-story-about-science-together-unconference-about-tools-and-rules-collaborative>this blog post</a> by <a href=https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/david-perez-suarez>David Perez-Suarez</a>).
The motivation is that its frustrating to see how few large projects have effective distributed collaboration practices.
She&rsquo;s thinking of running it entirely online (terribly meta 😆) and wonders what folks think about whether it would be useful and who would/should attend?</p><p><strong>Georgia</strong> is trying to cut down her paper draft at the moment and is looking for pruning tips! 🌳️️️✂️🍃
She also asked about tips for attending <a href=https://mozillafestival.org>MozFest</a> for the first time.
Patricia recommended making a schedule to try not to miss key sessions&mldr;but being ok with the fact that there will be conversations that you get pulled into that make staying really on top of things unlikely 😆
She and Kirstie both agreed that it&rsquo;s pretty intense so be sure to take a time out whenever you need it.
Also - the coffee and hot chocolate is free and delicious! 😋 ️🍫</p><p><strong>Yini</strong> shared a recent paper, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw4226>&ldquo;Inception of memories that guide vocal learning in the songbird&rdquo;</a> (💰, no OA version), which describes how researchers have successfully implanted memories into birds, allowing them to learn new tunes without being taught.
She&rsquo;s wondering if this kind of technology could be possible for humans in the future?
For example, for a person with <a href=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd>post traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) patient the process could modify the patient&rsquo;s memory in order to help them forget about the injury.
Its an open question as to whether this approach would be ethical or not?</p><p><strong>Ang</strong> wanted to know the lab&rsquo;s views on a recent &ldquo;matters arising&rdquo; conversation about a paper on <a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0438-y>&ldquo;Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes&rdquo;</a> (💰, no OA version) which was published in August of this year.
The <a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1582-8>comment</a> (💰, no OA version) titled &ldquo;One neuron versus deep learning in aftershock prediction&rdquo; pointed out that a simple logistic classification regression did just as well as neural network models.
The authors' <a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1582-8>replied</a> (💰, no OA version) that these are philosophical differences on the goals of the modelling.
Alternatively, a more cynical position may be that deep learning makes a paper more likely to be published in high impact journals than logistic regression 😒</p><p><strong>Sarah</strong> is thinking of starting a blog and is looking for tips!</p><p><strong>Elizabeth</strong> is wondering if anyone has suggestions for the ratio of papers-you-review to papers-you-publish? It can be a lot of work to review papers and she&rsquo;s wondering what rubrics people use beyond &ldquo;I think I could provide useful feedback to the authors.&rdquo;
<strong>Patricia</strong> shared a guideline of two papers for every paper you publish because your paper will need 2 reviewers (on average) and you should repay the favour to keep the system going.
But the problem with that is that papers have multiple co-authors that could review too, so the math probably doesn&rsquo;t quite work out.
<strong>Kirstie</strong> recommends doing 4 per year and saying no to the rest unless you would want to lead a journal club on the paper (that&rsquo;s the amount of work that goes into a review!)</p><h2 id=world-mental-health-day>World Mental Health Day</h2><p>Although we didn&rsquo;t have lab meeting in person today, the lab wanted to note <a href=https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/world-mental-health-day>World Mental Health Day</a>.
We collected together the following suggestions that we have each found valuable to support our mental health wellbeing.</p><ul><li>Sharing examples of inclusive work practices can reduce stress - for example <a href=https://twitter.com/sarahruthbeck/status/1182025155612155905>adding your work hours to your email signature</a>.</li><li>Monitoring your hormone cycle can help with predicting and understanding pain or mood swings.</li><li>There are good online resources for self help: <a href=https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk>https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk</a> and <a href=https://llttf.com>https://llttf.com</a>.</li><li>Meditation has helped some of us in the past.</li><li>Seek medical advice as soon as possible and take medication when necessary.
Anti-depressant, anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic drugs don&rsquo;t work for everyone, but they can make a huge difference when they do.</li><li>Ask for information at your university or workplace.
There are sometimes more resources - such as free councelling or health care support - than you imagine (and they can be hard to find on your own).</li><li>Remember that structural prejudice exists: it may not be you, it may be your environment making you feel bad.</li></ul><p>The theme of this year&rsquo;s World Mental Health Day was suicide prevention.
There are some useful helplines and other resources listed on the <a href=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/suicide>NHS webpage</a>.
If you are concerned that you are at risk of suicide you should <a href=https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/gp-visit-guide>seek the advice and support of your GP</a>.
If you are in distress and need immediate help <strong>please call 999 or go to A&E</strong> and ask to speak to the nearest crisis resolution team.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class="container sep-before"><div class=categories><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M22 19a2 2 0 01-2 2H4a2 2 0 01-2-2V5A2 2 0 014 3H9l2 3h9a2 2 0 012 2z"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Categories: </span><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>blog</a></div><div class=tags><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2H12l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Tags: </span><a class=tag href=/tags/lab-meeting/>lab-meeting</a></div></div></footer></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class="prev-entry sep-before"><a href=/blog/2019-10-03-lab-meeting/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
