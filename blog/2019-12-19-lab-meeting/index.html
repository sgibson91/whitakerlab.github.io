Working on the project has given me the confidence to present at events again and renewed trust in my skills (technical knowledge as well as organizing and running events), highlighted areas of expertise and shown me what I really value in interactions and collaborations.
I successfully applied for a <a href=https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-04-11-announcing-2019-software-sustainability-institute-fellows>Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship</a>, became a <a href=https://carpentries.org>Carpentries</a> instructor and found a new job that aligns more with my values and beliefs.
They both provide me with opportunities to give back to the open community that has supported me in the past and I can&rsquo;t wait to start mentoring for the <a href=https://openlifesci.org>Open Life Science</a> programme and get involved in other open projects in 2020.</p><h2 id=sarah-gibson>Sarah Gibson</h2><p><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-12-19/SarahGibson_2019_reflections.jpg alt="Sarah&rsquo;s 2019 collage"></p><p>I am proud of how my presenting skills have developed over the last year.
While I never considered teaching and public speaking to be my strongest skills, I can take pride in having received very positive feedback.
I&rsquo;m also proud of the network of amazing people I&rsquo;ve managed to surround myself with.
I&rsquo;m also really proud to have been invited to join the <a href=https://mybinder.org/>mybinder.org</a> <a href=https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/the-operators-no-binder-isnt-forming-a-rock-band/694>operating team</a>.</p><ul><li>Applied to be a 2020 <a href=https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme>SSI Fellow</a> 🤞🤞🤞 and <a href=https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/208>openly developed the application</a> on GitHub.</li><li>Took initiative to contribute/organise for the community.</li><li>People actually ask my opinion on things now, like I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.
And they think it&rsquo;s a good idea for me to express those opinions on a <a href="https://twitter.com/drsarahlgibson/status/1174034713885007874?s=20">panel at RSE Con</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=konrad-adler-wagstyl>Konrad Adler-Wagstyl</h2><p><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-12-19/KonradAdlerWagstyl_2019_reflections.png alt="Konrad&rsquo;s 2019 collage"></p><p>After 10 years being a student, 2019 was the year I finally finished medicine and started full time in research.
I&rsquo;ve absolutely loved reinvigorating existing collaborations and starting new ones.</p><p>The <a href=https://meldproject.github.io/>MELD project</a> continues to expand, with new sites, researchers and clinical validation projects.
It&rsquo;s been great to see the spreading enthusiasm for working openly in the field.</p><p>One highlight this year was <a href="https://twitter.com/KonradWagstyl/status/1194581130521055234?s=20">leading my first open science workshop</a>.
It was a real joy sharing the diverse, openly available tools that are part of our workflow and seeing how everyone in the room wanted to try them out immediately.</p><p>One thing I&rsquo;ve realised this year is that I work best with others.
Working so openly in MELD has made it much easier to collaborate.
For 2020 I hope to do the same with my work on cortical microstructure - making the tools and data for analysing cortical layers and columns more open and accessible.</p><h2 id=louise-bowler>Louise Bowler</h2><p><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-12-19/LouiseBowler_2019_reflections.jpg alt="Louise&rsquo;s 2019 collage"></p><p>A common theme for me throughout 2019 has been finishing things - it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve wrapped up projects at the Turing, and I also tied up some loose ends from my PhD and finally graduated.</p><p>The <a href=https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/artificial-intelligence-ai/programme-articles/urban-mobility-innovations-get-everyone-moving>Toyota Mobility Foundation visualisation project</a> has been my most technical project at the Turing so far.
I really enjoyed the move into web development and visualisation, and I learnt so much over the course of the project.
Looking back at the code now, I can see how far I&rsquo;ve come - it&rsquo;s very difficult to say that I&rsquo;ve made the &ldquo;final, final&rdquo; change!</p><p><a href=https://the-turing-way.netlify.com><em>The Turing Way</em></a> has been a huge influence on me this year - as an introvert, working openly in a big team was initially a daunting step for me, but I have really come to value how the effort we put into building the community is reflected in peoples' acceptance, friendliness, politeness and helpfulness throughout the entire project.
I&rsquo;m sure <em>The Turing Way</em> is in for another successful year, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing it happen.</p><p>Thanks to the Turing&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/research-engineering>Research Engineering Group</a> for the photo from RSECon.</p><h2 id=ang-li>Ang Li</h2><p><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-12-19/AngLi_2019_reflections.png alt="Ang&rsquo;s 2019 collage"></p><p>2019 is a special year for me as a visiting student in the UK and I appreciate Kirstie a lot to give me this opportunity.
Living in London means that I have to rent a room and cook for myself.
I can do really good cooking now and have fun with my landlord&rsquo;s dog (shown in the picture)!</p><p>I have worked with Kirstie and Yini to develop a registered report based on the ABCD project, with all code and pipeline available.
Several of my other works also went well.
At the same time, I learned a lot from Kirstie in the use of Github as well as <a href=https://the-turing-way.netlify.com><em>The Turing Way</em></a>.
I&rsquo;m excited in preparation for contributing a new section in power analysis.
Really looking forward to more chapters in <em>The Turing Way</em>.</p><p>I have attended several really wonderful conferences in Europe, including <a href=https://www.cnn.group.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-networks-day>Cambridge Network Day</a>, <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3882&activateFull=true">OHBM</a> and <a href=http://www.luminous-project.eu/index.php/workshop-studying-measuring-and-altering-consciousness/>Luminous workshop</a>, and they are all amazing!
Moreover, I gave my first English presentation in public at the Turing mental health group.</p><h2 id=georgia-aitkenhead>Georgia Aitkenhead</h2><p><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-12-19/GeorgiaAitkenhead_2019_reflections.png alt="Georgia&rsquo;s 2019 collage"></p><p>2019 has been a year of many new horizons!
I&rsquo;ve loved my first year at the Turing -so many amazing people and projects, and of course Kirstie&rsquo;s amazing mentoring 💖.
Python turned out not be as scary as it looked, but just as loopy!
And GitHub is friendly after all.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve especially enjoyed working with all my autistic collaborators.
The insight group has been really enlightening, and I&rsquo;ve loved learning about open science, reproducibility, and neuroscience from lab members.
I&rsquo;ve had the chance to deliver my project at conferences and events, and learned a huge amount - MozzFest, the ODI conference, and the eLife sprint all stand out - thanks so much for test-running my game, Yini, Ang and Patricia.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-dupre>Elizabeth DuPre</h2><p><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-12-19/ElizabethDuPre_2019_reflections.jpg alt="Elizabeth&rsquo;s 2019 collage"></p><p>I&rsquo;m spending the end of 2019 feeling really lucky for being where I am; to be working with so many wonderful, passionate people; and to have the freedom to explore topics I&rsquo;m really excited about.</p><p>For me, it was the year of joining the <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai>Neuro-AI community here in Montreal</a>, speaking at an international conference for the first time in the OHBM <a href=https://figshare.com/articles/Enabling_Open_Publishing_Building_Open_Tools_with_Open_Communities/8292269>open science symposium</a>, and heading back to <a href=https://neurohackademy.org/>Neurohackademy</a> for the first time since 2016 &ndash; but this time as an instructor!
It was also a year of building stronger communities for open source projects I really care about, like <a href=https://tedana.readthedocs.io>tedana</a> and <a href=http://nilearn.github.io>nilearn</a>.</p><h2 id=yini-he>Yini He</h2><p><img src=/images/lab-meeting/2019-12-19/YiniHe_2019_reflections.png alt="Elizabeth&rsquo;s 2019 collage"></p><p>This was the first time I stay in a foreign country for such a long time.
I am so grateful that you always gave me hands.
I never felt alone at Turing, and everyone in our lab is invisible energy for me.
Many thanks.
With your help, I can face my disadvantage, leave my comfort zone and start moving forward.</p><p>It is my pleasure to take part in the ABCD project, and from this project, I learned the ideas of open science from Kirstie.
It is happy for me to study python with Georgia.
Ang taught me a lot about genetic research and became my programming teacher.</p><p>I hope I can take part in and make contributions to <em>The Turing Way</em> in the new year!!!</p><h2 id=kirstie-whitaker>Kirstie Whitaker</h2><p><em>It&rsquo;s worth acknowledging here that I suggested 150 words to everyone else&mldr;.and completely disregarded that for my update.</em>

Take a listen here: <a href=https://conp.ca/conp-elizabeth-dupre-ana-van-gulick-and-john-borghi>https://conp.ca/conp-elizabeth-dupre-ana-van-gulick-and-john-borghi</a></p><p>She also shared an interesting discussion in the Carpentries community about <a href=https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/T0d0e93b3a52c01f4-Ma49c6e992af186ba68a29ae7/community-discussion-on-the-carpentries-teaching-of-github>teaching GitHub given their recently publicized ICE contract</a>.
I don&rsquo;t know what the right move is, here, but I think it&rsquo;s something to be aware of.
<strong>Patricia</strong> and <strong>Yo</strong> pointed out that <a href=https://twitter.com/SCEdmunds/status/1186401840948137984>Gitlab isn&rsquo;t always available in China</a> so it seems to be really hard to find a solution that is open to everyone 😢</p><p><strong>Louise</strong> built on Elizabeth&rsquo;s point and shared the <a href=https://pad.carpentries.org/git-discussion>summary</a> of the Carpentries' group calls about teaching git/GitHub which make for interesting reading.
There are a couple of other calls coming up about the git curriculum this and next week; it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what they want to change.
In addition to the issue about GitHub&rsquo;s contract with ICE, there are also some suggestions for alternative stories and the use of GUIs in addition to teaching git via the command line only.</p><p><strong>Sarah</strong> is <em>SO</em> ready for the Christmas break 😴 (and she isn&rsquo;t alone!).

She reminded everyone to check their travel plans before they set out over Christmas.</p><p>She shared this beautiful picture of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Lights_(Lyon)>Festival of Lights</a> in Lyon.</p><p>Finally, you can change your <a href=https://smile.amazon.co.uk/>Amazon Smile</a> charity to <a href=https://www.autistica.org.uk/>Autistica</a> to support their great work if you&rsquo;d like to.</p><h2 id=questions-were-thinking-about>Questions we&rsquo;re thinking about</h2><p>At the dinner <strong>Konrad</strong> asked how labs can be configured to engender a great working environment?
For example, some have slow coffee making facillities that encourage informal work chats.
Making sure that the workspace is welcoming (not in a basement for example!) so folks want to come in!</p><p><strong>Elizabeth</strong> shared an idea that hot-desking, or a similar semi-fluid seating arrangement could encourage folks to interact with the lab more broadly.
I think this can be done really well (but I also worry it could be done really badly!) to help create connections.</p><p><strong>Ang</strong> agreed that what the Turing does very well is have so many meeting rooms.
Probably the best balance is to have places to work quietly and alone (e.g. do some writing or coding) and places for communication (e.g. brainstorming) that everyone in the lab can freely choose between.</p><p><strong>Kirstie</strong> shared <a href=https://seeq12.github.io/qube/>this amazing tool</a> that links Zoom and Slack to provide a virtual workplace!</p><p><strong>Patricia</strong> is considering joining the Labour party because she wants to do <em>something</em> to change politics in this country (also, in Scotland they probably don&rsquo;t really stand much chance at the moment).
She asked &ldquo;Is that a good idea or is focussing on local kindness better?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Konrad</strong> and <strong>Georgia</strong> agreed that they&rsquo;re feeling similarly stuck and despondent.
It is possible to wait to know who the leadership candidates are before joining up, so it isn&rsquo;t an urgent decision, just one to keep a careful eye on.</p><p><strong>Sarah</strong> shared that she always finds these questions the hardest section of Whitaker lab meetings?
Its hard to know what to ask that isn&rsquo;t too broad that she&rsquo;s not going to do anything with it, or so specific that no one in this group is likely to be able to help her.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth</strong>, <strong>Louise</strong> and <strong>Yini</strong> all shared a strong agree 😅
(Most of the time) it&rsquo;s a good kind of difficult and very dependent on what&rsquo;s going on in a given week.
Technical aspects are where the lab are the most different to each other but it is easier to find questions about work processes, outreach, teaching, events etc.
In general, it&rsquo;s hard when there is a definitive answer, and easier when there are lots of opinions about a topic and when a discussion about it would be helpful.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth</strong> is trying to help put some collaborators on a good path for thinking about project management and community building.
She asked whether, other than absolutely everything from Mozilla Open Leaders (💖), are there resources we&rsquo;d recommend?</p><p><strong>Louise</strong> is starting to think about topics for next year&rsquo;s reproducible research lunches.
We had quite a few PhD students coming along last term so she wants to keep things going 😄
Any ideas, suggestions or volunteers?
A couple of ideas we didn&rsquo;t manage to fit in last term were testing and research data management.
Some project demos would be great, but finding volunteers is much harder!</p><p><strong>Georgia</strong> is doing qualitative analysis and was wondering if anyone has expertise they can share for analysing and extracting themes from group discussions?</p><p><strong>Yini</strong> shared a paper published in neuroimage: &ldquo;Agito ergo sum: Correlates of spatio-temporal motion characteristics during fMRI&rdquo; (doi: <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116433>10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116433</a>).
It showed fMRI head movement is associated with too many factors such as weight, height, sleep, self-regulation, working memory，etc.
She wondered if these correlations are sometimes influenced by mediating factors?</p><p><strong>Ang</strong> asked about tips for a visiting student to spend his time during Christmas in London (when not working at home)?</p><p><strong>Louise</strong> recommended that he enjoy the peace and quiet while he can 😄</p><blockquote><p>A university friend of mine who stayed in London over Christmas used to enjoy going for walks around the city on Christmas Day/Boxing Day because there were so few people there.
Personally, I really like the area of South Kensington during winter - they put lights up around the Natural History museum and it looks lovely at nighttime.
They have an ice rink there too if that&rsquo;s your kind of thing.
The others museums there are great too - the Science Museum and the V&A.
Going a bit further north, Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath are both lovely places to go for walks if it&rsquo;s one of those cold, sunny and crisp days - but make sure to wrap up warm!</p></blockquote><h2 id=anything-else>Anything else</h2><p>That is <em><strong>more than enough</strong></em> for this final blog post of the year.
As I said above, I&rsquo;m do delighted to be a member of this awe inspiring group.</p><p>Happy holidays everyone.
Rest, and enjoy the break 🎄 🎁 🌟</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class="container sep-before"><div class=categories><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M22 19a2 2 0 01-2 2H4a2 2 0 01-2-2V5A2 2 0 014 3H9l2 3h9a2 2 0 012 2z"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Categories: </span><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>blog</a></div><div class=tags><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2H12l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Tags: </span><a class=tag href=/tags/lab-meeting/>lab-meeting</a></div></div></footer></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class="prev-entry sep-before"><a href=/blog/2019-10-17-lab-meeting/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
